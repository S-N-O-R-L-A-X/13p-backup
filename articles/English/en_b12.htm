          play 3NT.</font>
    </blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Many pairs solve this problem with
        a treatment called <b><i>New Minor Forcing.</i></b>&nbsp; This is a simple
        bidding agreement that specifies that after the first round of bidding,
        responder's rebid of 2 of the unbid (&quot;new&quot;) minor is forcing for at
        least one round, and it may be artificial. It asks opener for more information
        about his hand, specifically his length in the suit responder has already bid.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">New Minor Forcing is used only by
        responder, usually at his second turn to bid. You should have at least <b>invitational
          strength </b>(a good 10-11+ pts.) and some doubt about what the final contract
        should be. In most cases, you have a 5-card major and want to know whether or
        not partner has a fit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">With the example hand above, clubs
        is the new minor, so after 1D-1S-1NT, you would rebid 2C to force. Your bid
        doesn't promise club length or even a stopper -- it only asks opener to bid
        again and tell you more about his hand.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Some players call this Checkback
        Stayman because it gives you a way to check back with partner about his
        support for your major. Unlike the 2C Stayman convention you use after a 1NT
        opener, though, this bid doesn't ask for a 4-card major. Instead, it asks
        opener if he has <b><i>3 cards</i></b> in the major you've already bid.</font>

      <font size="2">Opener's Rebids</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">After partner bids the new minor,
        your first obligation as opener is to show support for his major. You do this
        by making a &quot;delayed raise&quot; to two of his suit. In the example
        above, your auction would go 1D by you&nbsp; - 1S by partner - 1NT - 2C - <b>2S</b>.
        Your 2S rebid shows exactly 3 spades (you already denied 4-card spade support
        when you rebid 1NT). This uncovers your 8-card fit, so your partner will jump
        directly to 4S with the example hand.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If you rebid anything else over
        partner's New Minor Forcing bid, you <b><i>deny</i></b> 3-card length in his
        major. Your second priority is to show an unbid 4-card major. In the example
        above, you would rebid 2H if you held 2 spades and 4 hearts.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If you don't have 3 spades <b><i>or</i></b>
        4 hearts, you have to find another descriptive rebid. You can choose 2NT if
        you have stoppers in hearts <b><i>and</i></b> clubs, or 2D if you have a
        5-card suit. In all of these cases, partner will now know that you have only a
        7-card spade fit, so he can choose the 3NT game.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">As opener, you can also show your
        point-count with your rebid. Since responder promises at least invitational
        strength, you can&nbsp; make a <b>jump rebid</b> if you have a maximum hand
        that will accept a game invitation. After partner bids 2C in the auction
        above, you would jump to 3S if you had strong 3-card support and a good 14 or
        15 pts. If you had only a doubleton spade and a good 14-15 pts., you would
        jump to 3NT.</font>

      <font size="2">Responder's Third Bid</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">After you use New Minor Forcing,
        opener's rebid will tell you whether or not you have an 8-card fit in your
        suit. <b><i>Your</i></b> next bid should tell opener whether you have <b>forcing</b>
        or <b>invitational</b> strength.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">With the example hand above, you
        have<b> forcing values </b>(12-13+ pts.), so your next bid will be at game
        level. If opener rebids 2S to show 3-card support, you'll bid 4S. If opener
        rebids anything else (2D, 2H, 2NT), you know you have only a 7-card spade fit,
        so you'll choose 3NT.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If you have only <b>invitational
          values</b> (10-11 pts.), you'll make your rebid at a lower level. Here's an
        example:</font>
    <blockquote>
