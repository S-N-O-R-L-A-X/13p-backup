  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here's a frequent bidding dilemma:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>KQ854&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A82&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">J5&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K72 
    -- </b>Partner opens 1D, you respond 1S, and partner rebids 1NT. You know 
    you want to bid game, but which game? If partner has three spades, a 4S 
    contract rates to play better. If partner has only two spades, you'd rather 
    play 3NT.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Many pairs solve this problem with 
  a treatment called <b><i>New Minor Forcing.</i></b>&nbsp; This is a simple 
  bidding agreement that specifies that after the first round of bidding, 
  responder's rebid of 2 of the unbid (&quot;new&quot;) minor is forcing for at 
  least one round, and it may be artificial. It asks opener for more information 
  about his hand, specifically his length in the suit responder has already bid.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">New Minor Forcing is used only by 
  responder, usually at his second turn to bid. You should have at least <b>invitational 
  strength </b>(a good 10-11+ pts.) and some doubt about what the final contract 
  should be. In most cases, you have a 5-card major and want to know whether or 
  not partner has a fit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With the example hand above, clubs 
  is the new minor, so after 1D-1S-1NT, you would rebid 2C to force. Your bid 
  doesn't promise club length or even a stopper -- it only asks opener to bid 
  again and tell you more about his hand.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some players call this Checkback 
  Stayman because it gives you a way to check back with partner about his 
  support for your major. Unlike the 2C Stayman convention you use after a 1NT 
  opener, though, this bid doesn't ask for a 4-card major. Instead, it asks 
  opener if he has <b><i>3 cards</i></b> in the major you've already bid.</font>

  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opener's Rebids</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After partner bids the new minor, 
  your first obligation as opener is to show support for his major. You do this 
  by making a &quot;delayed raise&quot; to two of his suit. In the example 
  above, your auction would go 1D by you&nbsp; - 1S by partner - 1NT - 2C - <b>2S</b>. 
  Your 2S rebid shows exactly 3 spades (you already denied 4-card spade support 
  when you rebid 1NT). This uncovers your 8-card fit, so your partner will jump 
  directly to 4S with the example hand.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you rebid anything else over 
  partner's New Minor Forcing bid, you <b><i>deny</i></b> 3-card length in his 
  major. Your second priority is to show an unbid 4-card major. In the example 
  above, you would rebid 2H if you held 2 spades and 4 hearts.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you don't have 3 spades <b><i>or</i></b> 
  4 hearts, you have to find another descriptive rebid. You can choose 2NT if 
  you have stoppers in hearts <b><i>and</i></b> clubs, or 2D if you have a 
  5-card suit. In all of these cases, partner will now know that you have only a 
  7-card spade fit, so he can choose the 3NT game.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">As opener, you can also show your 
  point-count with your rebid. Since responder promises at least invitational 
  strength, you can&nbsp; make a <b>jump rebid</b> if you have a maximum hand 
  that will accept a game invitation. After partner bids 2C in the auction 
  above, you would jump to 3S if you had strong 3-card support and a good 14 or 
  15 pts. If you had only a doubleton spade and a good 14-15 pts., you would 
  jump to 3NT.</font>

  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responder's Third Bid</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After you use New Minor Forcing, 
  opener's rebid will tell you whether or not you have an 8-card fit in your 
  suit. <b><i>Your</i></b> next bid should tell opener whether you have <b>forcing</b> 
  or <b>invitational</b> strength.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With the example hand above, you 
  have<b> forcing values </b>(12-13+ pts.), so your next bid will be at game 
  level. If opener rebids 2S to show 3-card support, you'll bid 4S. If opener 
  rebids anything else (2D, 2H, 2NT), you know you have only a 7-card spade fit, 
  so you'll choose 3NT.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you have only <b>invitational 
  values</b> (10-11 pts.), you'll make your rebid at a lower level. Here's an 
  example:</font>

    -- </b>Partner opens 1D, you bid 1H, and he rebids 1S. To start an 
    invitational auction and check on partner's heart length, bid 2C (New Minor 
    Forcing). Here are opener's possible rebids and the actions you should take 
    at your next turn to bid.&nbsp;<br>

    -- </b>Partner opens 1C, you respond 1S, and partner bids 1NT. In this 
    auction (after opener rebids 1NT), a bid of 2H by you should show a <b>weak 
    hand</b> (6-9 pts.) with no interest in game -- it promises 5 spades and 4+ 
    hearts and asks opener to pass or bid 2S if he prefers that suit. To show an 
    <b>invitational</b> <b>or better</b> hand, bid 2D (yes, even with a 
    singleton!) to force. This will allow you to find an 8-card fit in <b><i>either</i></b> 
    major. If partner has 3 spades, he'll bid 2S and you'll raise to 3S to 
    invite. If he has 2 spades and 4 hearts, he'll bid 2H and you can invite a 
    heart game with by raising to 3H.</font>

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In some auctions, there won't be a 
  new minor available:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>1043&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ986&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K7&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ8 
    -- </b>Partner opens 1D, you bid 1H and he rebids 2C (showing at least 9 
    cards in the two minor suits). In this case, you'll have to improvise by 
    bidding <b>2S</b> (the <b>new <i>major)</i></b>, which is the only unbid 
    suit.&nbsp; Since this is the only forcing bid available, it doesn't promise 
    length or even honor strength in spades. It's an artificial force that asks 
    partner to tell you more about his hand. If partner rebids 3H (showing 
    3-card support), you'll bid 4H. If he rebids 2NT, he promises a spade 
    stopper and you can raise to 3NT.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over your 2S, if partner rebids 3C or 
    3D, he's showing extra length in that suit, and your auction will be 
    trickier. After 3C or 3D, a 3S bid by you should be a search for 3NT that <b><i>asks</i></b> 
    for a spade stopper. If partner doesn't have one, he'll bid something other 
    than 3NT, and you'll try the minor-suit game.</font>
