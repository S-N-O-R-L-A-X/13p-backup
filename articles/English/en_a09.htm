  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="4">Responder's Bids in 
  Competition</font></strong></h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">An opponent's overcall of your 
  partner's opening bid can make it more difficult for you to find an accurate 
  response. Many partnerships run into trouble because they aren't sure of how 
  -- or if -- the intervening overcall should change the meaning of responder's 
  actions.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If your partner opens the bidding 
  and your right-hand opponent (RHO) makes an overcall, most of your responding 
  bids carry the same general meaning as those you would have made if your RHO 
  had passed. Some responses, however, should be shaded up or down somewhat. In 
  general, your &quot;freebids&quot; of notrump should be near the top of your 
  range. Your suit bids, however -- especially when you're raising partner's 
  suit -- need not show anything extra. Here are some guidelines for choosing 
  your response:</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>If partner opens and your 
  RHO overcalls a suit</strong> (1H by partner - 1S on your right):</font></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>1NT</strong> = 8-10 
      pts. with good stoppers in the opponent's suit.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>2NT</strong> = 10-12 
      pts. with good stoppers in the opponent's suit.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>3NT</strong> = 12-15 
      pts. with good stoppers in the opponent's suit.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Double = </strong>Can 
      carry one of two meanings, depending on what you and your partner agree:<br>
      <strong>1 - Penalty,</strong> which is the &quot;Standard American&quot; 
      meaning. This double should only be made with a long, strong trump holding 
      in the opponent's suit. <strong>OR</strong><br>
      <strong>2 - Negative, </strong>showing at least a fair responding hand (8+ 
      playing pts.) and 4-card length in the unbid suits (especially the unbid 
      major). If opener has 4-card length in one of the suits you're showing, he 
      bids it. If not, he must find another descriptive bid.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>1-level bid in a new 
      suit</strong> = 6+ pts., 4-card suit. If you have a bare 6 pts., you 
      should have a good suit. If your partnership plays negative doubles, the 
      freebid promises a <strong><i>5+-card suit.</i></strong></font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>2-level bid in a new 
      suit</strong> = 10+ pts., 4-card suit. If your partnership plays negative 
      doubles, the freebid promises a <strong><i>5+-card suit.</i></strong></font></li>

    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Raise to 2 of 
      partner's suit = </strong>5-10 pts. with 3+-card support if partner opened 
      a major; 4+-card support if partner opened a minor.You should stretch to 
      raise partner if you have trump support and playing strength, even if you 
      have sub-minimum point-count.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Raise to 3 of 
      partner's suit (invitational)</strong> = 10-11 pts. with 3-card support if 
      partner opened a major; 4+-card sup<i><b>port if partner opened a minor.<br>
      NOTE</b></i>: Some pairs use the jump raise to show a <i><b>weak</b></i> 
      hand (3-7 pts.) with good trump support and playing strength. If you 
      choose this meaning, you can use the cuebid (see below) to show a hand 
      with invitational-or-better strength.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Cuebid after partner 
      opens a minor</strong> (1D-[1S]-2S) = Game-forcing hand (12+ pts.), 
      usually with no other good descriptive bid available. Your bid of the 
      opponent's suit is forcing and asks opener to tell you more about his 
      hand. Opener's first obligation is to show you a major suit if he has one; 
      if not, he should bid notrump if he has good stoppers in the opponent's 
      overcalled suit.</font></li>

      partner's major</strong> (1H-[1S]-4H) = 5-11 pts., long, strong trumps and 
      good distributional strength. With a much stronger hand, you can start 
      with a cuebid of the opponent's suit, then bid game in partner's suit at 
      your next turn.</font></li>
