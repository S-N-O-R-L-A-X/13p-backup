        <font size="4">Responder's Bids in
          Competition</font>
      </strong></h2>
    <hr>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">An opponent's overcall of your
        partner's opening bid can make it more difficult for you to find an accurate
        response. Many partnerships run into trouble because they aren't sure of how
        -- or if -- the intervening overcall should change the meaning of responder's
        actions.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If your partner opens the bidding
        and your right-hand opponent (RHO) makes an overcall, most of your responding
        bids carry the same general meaning as those you would have made if your RHO
        had passed. Some responses, however, should be shaded up or down somewhat. In
        general, your &quot;freebids&quot; of notrump should be near the top of your
        range. Your suit bids, however -- especially when you're raising partner's
        suit -- need not show anything extra. Here are some guidelines for choosing
        your response:</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><strong>If partner opens and your
          RHO overcalls a suit</strong> (1H by partner - 1S on your right):</font>

            <strong>1 - Penalty,</strong> which is the &quot;Standard American&quot;
            meaning. This double should only be made with a long, strong trump holding
            in the opponent's suit. <strong>OR</strong><br>
            <strong>2 - Negative, </strong>showing at least a fair responding hand (8+
            playing pts.) and 4-card length in the unbid suits (especially the unbid
            major). If opener has 4-card length in one of the suits you're showing, he
            bids it. If not, he must find another descriptive bid.

            opponent's suit is forcing and asks opener to tell you more about his
            hand. Opener's first obligation is to show you a major suit if he has one;
