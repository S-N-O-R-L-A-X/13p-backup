  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Learning Bridge:&nbsp; Developing 
  your card sense</font></h2>
  <hr width="100%">
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One of the keys to becoming a good 
  bridge player is to develop &quot;card sense&quot;, which is generally defined 
  as an aptitude for card games. Many people will tell you that you have to be 
  born with it, or that it must be acquired at an early age. But is it an inborn 
  talent, or an ability that can be developed?</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">It's true that some people seem to 
  have a natural gift for cards, and if you played lots of card games as a 
  child, you probably have a head start. Bridge card sense, however, is 
  something that almost any intelligent, motivated learner can develop. It 
  involves knowing the relationships between cards, visualizing how the deck is 
  divided among the four hands, and in general, just having a good understanding 
  of how tricks are won.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Even if you're an adult who's 
  never seen a deck of cards, you can develop these mental facilities. With 
  practice, you can actually &quot;teach&quot; your brain to process information 
  about cards. In doing so, you'll develop memory skills that are useful not 
  just for playing bridge, but for many other mental activities. Here are some 
  activities you can use to speed up the process:</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Try memory exercises.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Take 6 or 7 cards out of the deck 
  and look at them for 5 seconds. Turn them over and try to remember as many as 
  possible. As you improve, try dealing out more cards and looking at them for a 
  shorter time. Another good memory exercise is the children's game of 
  &quot;Concentration&quot;.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Practice &quot;double-dummy&quot; 
  play.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You don't need other people to 
  practice bidding and playing a bridge hand. Deal out a hand with the cards 
  face-up. Decide what each hand would (or should) bid, what the final contract 
  should be, what the opening lead would be, and how you would play the hand if 
  you were declarer. Then play out the hand trick-by-trick, pretending you're 
  each hand in turn.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Experiment with suit 
  combinations.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One of the best ways to learn how 
  to take tricks with various card combinations is to practice them in 
  isolation. Take 13 cards of one suit out of the deck. For declarers' and 
  dummy's hands, take 7, 8 or 9 of the cards out, deal them into two piles (any 
  number in each pile) and turn them face up. Decide how many tricks you think 
  you should be able to take with the two face-up hands and in what order you 
  would play the cards to achieve that result.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Next, &quot;test&quot; your play 
  by adding the defenders' hands. Deal the remaining cards into two piles (any 
  number in each pile) so you have a full layout of the suit as it might be at 
  the table. Decide which card you would play to each trick if you were a 
  defender.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Repeat the exercise by making 
  small variations in your original layout. Move a jack from declarer's hand to 
  dummy's, change the number of cards in each defender's hand, etc. and see how 
  it would change your play and the number of tricks you can take.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Read and deal.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Bridge books will teach you how to 
  play card combinations and give you other basic knowledge you need to develop 
  card sense. Reading and practicing don't have to be separate activities, 
  though. Keep a deck of cards with your bridge book and use it to translate the 
  book's diagrammed hands into &quot;real&quot; bridge hands. Deal out the cards 
  to match the example in the book and play it out on a tabletop next to the 
  open book. Replay it as many times as you like until you understand the 
  principle or the technique. This exercise is especially beneficial if you're 
  studying suit combinations or reading a book on declarer play.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Practice daily.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">To add continuity to the learning 
  process and keep your brain stimulated, try to spend at least a few minutes 
  with some bridge-related activity every day. Here are some good practice and 
  study activities that are fun, but not time consuming:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Keep a deck of cards handy -- 
      on your desk at work, or on your coffeetable or nightstand at home -- and 
      when you have a few minutes (or the boss isn't looking), deal out a 
      practice hand.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Read the bridge column in the 
      newspaper. Keep in mind that most columnists write for intermediate-level 
      players, so don't be discouraged if some of the explanations don't make 
      sense. Just use what you know and do your own analysis. Look at the hand 
      diagram and decide what you would bid with each hand, what opening lead 
      you would make, how you would declare or defend the contract, etc.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Keep your class notes and 
      bridge book accessible. Read a chapter, or even a few pages, during your 
      coffee break, between TV shows, before you go to sleep.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Bookmark some bridge web sites 
      and visit your favorites to see what's new.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Play a hand or two on your 
      computer.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If your local TV stations are 
      running one of the new bridge programs, tape the weekly show and watch all 
      or part of it whenever it's convenient.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The play's the thing.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Experience itself is the best 
  teacher of card sense, so the more time you spend actually playing bridge, the 
  faster you'll develop your abilities. Don't feel like you have to know 
  everything to begin playing. As soon as you've finished a few lessons, 
  organize a weekly game with some friends or the people from your class, or 
  recruit co-workers for a lunch-time game at work. You'll pick up more skills 
  every time you play, especially if you can get some more experienced players 
  to join your game.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Try to keep playing regularly 
  after you've finished your lessons. One option you should consider is 
  duplicate bridge. You don't have to be an expert, or even a very experienced 
  beginner, to join the games at your local bridge club. Almost every community 
  has at least one weekly duplicate game, and many are for novices only. If you 
  don't have a partner, the director or club manager will usually find one for 
  you, or you can just kibitz the other players if you like. Feel free to ask 
  questions after you play or watch a hand. Although you probably won't win (or 
  even avoid coming in last) the first few times you play, it's a great learning 
  experience.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Try these suggestions to see which 
  work best for you, and use your imagination to identify other learning and 
  practice opportunities. Developing your card sense will take time, but if you 
  are committed enough to put some effort into it, it will come. And with every 
  small step you make, you'll probably find that you enjoy playing bridge even 
  more than before.<br>
