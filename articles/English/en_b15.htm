  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Law of Total Tricks</font></h2>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A simplified use for partscore 
  bidding decisions.</font></h4>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The Law of Total Tricks is a 
  fairly complex set of principles that experienced bridge players use to decide 
  how high to bid in competitive auctions. Two entire books are devoted to 
  &quot;The Law&quot; (<i>To</i> <i>Bid</i> <i>or</i> <i>Not</i> <i>to</i> <i>Bid</i> 
  and <i>Following</i> <i>the</i> <i>Law</i> by Larry Cohen), but there are some 
  basic elements of the Law that beginners can adopt.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Described here is a simplified 
  version of a guideline you can use to decide if you should pass and let the 
  opponents play in their partscore, or if you should bid one level higher in 
  your suit. It operates on the principle that &quot;trumps are (almost) 
  everything&quot; and high-card strength is not critical. In its simplest form, 
  the rule is:</font>
  <hr>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2"><i>On partscore deals</i> 
    &nbsp;(where each partnership has a combined total of about 17-23 high-card 
    points):<br>
    the number of tricks you can take on offense is equal to the combined number 
    of trumps you hold.</font></b>
  </blockquote>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In practice, this means that if 
  you and partner have only an 8-card fit, you should usually stop at the 
  2-level. If you have a 9-card fit, you can safely bid 3 of your suit if the 
  opponents try to force you one level higher.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Using the Law</font></h3>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">    <u>Partner  RHO   You   LHO    </u>

(1)   1H     1S    2H    2S       
       ?     

(2)   1C    Pass   1S    2D     
      2S     3D     ?     </font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In Auction (1), partner should 
  take the &quot;push&quot; to 3H <i><b>only</b></i> if he has a sixth heart, 
  even if he has a bare 11-12 pts. If partner passes, he's showing a minimum 
  opener with only 5 hearts -- when this auction comes back to you, <b>you</b> 
  will bid 3H <i><b>only</b></i> if you have an extra trump (4 hearts instead of 
  the 3 you've promised). Again, points don't matter -- if you have 4-card heart 
  support, bid 3H, even with a weak hand &nbsp;(<b><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">43 
  &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">10854 &nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ94 
  &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">Q86</b>).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In Auction (2), partner should 
  never be the one to bid 3S because he can't have an extra trump (the auction 
  has told you he holds a minimum opener with <b><i>exactly </i></b>4 spades). 
  The decision is up to you. If you have the high-card strength to make a game, 
  go ahead and bid 4S. But if it's a partscore deal (one where you have a weaker 
  hand of 6-10 pts. and wanted to stop in 2S), you should bid 3S now only if you 
  have a 5-card suit (one more than you showed with your 1S response). You would 
  bid 3S here with &nbsp;<b><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">J10843 
  &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">K4 &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">654 
  &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ2 </b>. You should 
  pass with &nbsp; <b><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ43 
  &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">K64 &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">J54&nbsp; 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ2</b></font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><i><b>Note</b>:</i> In competitive 
  auctions like those above, the partner who bids at the 3-level is <i><b>not</b></i> 
  inviting game nor showing extra points. He is merely competing, and the other 
  partner should always pass. If you have extra values and want to invite game, 
  you must make a game-try bid in a new suit.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Adjustments to the Law</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">There are a few special cases 
  where you might want to violate this rule and bid to a level higher than the 
  number of trumps you hold. You would only do this if your hand has a good 
  combination of the following features:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A strong trump holding</b> 
      -- K107 instead of 643.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Honor strength or length in 
      a side suit partner has bid</b> -- in Auction (2) above, help in clubs (a 
      holding of Kx, QJx, Jxxx, etc.) would be an asset.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>No honor wastage in the 
      opponent's suit</b> -- if you hold lower honors (jacks, queens, kings) in 
      the opponent's suit, they may be valuable only if you're defending.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Shortness in the opponent's 
      suit</b> -- best is a singleton or void, but even a doubleton may provide 
      a ruffing value.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Unbalanced distribution</b> 
      -- something better than 4-3-3-3.</font></li>
  </ul>
