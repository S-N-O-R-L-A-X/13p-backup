  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="4">Slam Bidding</font></b></h2>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Decision #1</u></b>: Do you 
  have enough overall strength?</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When considering a slam, you have 
  to first decide if your two hands have the power to take 12 or 13 tricks once 
  you get the lead. You can often add your points to the number partner has 
  shown to determine your chances. <b><i>For &quot;normal&quot;, fairly balanced 
  hands</i></b>, use these guidelines:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">To make a small slam (bid of 
      6) -- you need 33 pts.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">To make a grand slam (bid of 
      7) -- you need 37 pts.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You may make a slam with fewer 
  points if your hands have other features to make up for what you lack in 
  high-card strength. These include:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Extra trumps -- </b>you 
      need at least an 8-card fit to bid a suit slam, but stronger fits produce 
      more tricks. You may score an extra trick for each trump you have over 8.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Long, strong side suits -- </b>if 
      you can set up and run a long side suit, the small cards can be as 
      valuable as honors.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Short</b> <b>suits -- </b>once 
      you know you have a trump fit, add in your distribution points to 
      determine your hand's full value. Voids, singletons and doubletons can 
      provide extra tricks by allowing you to score trumps separately.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><b><u><font size="2">Decision #2</font></u></b><font size="2">: 
  Do you have enough controls?</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your second concern is having 
  enough &quot;controls&quot; -- aces, kings, singletons and voids -- to prevent 
  the opponents from cashing two quick tricks. To bid and make a slam, your two 
  hands must have:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A first-round control (Ace or 
      Void) in at least three of the four suits.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">At least second-round control 
      (King, KQ, or singleton) in every suit.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Depending on the situation, you 
  can use <b><i>Blackwood</i></b> (to ask for aces after a suit bid),<b><i> 
  Gerber</i></b> (to ask for aces after a notrump bid), or <b><i>Cuebids</i></b> 
  (to find aces when Blackwood can't be used).&nbsp;</font>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><b><u><font size="2">The Blackwood Convention</font></u></b><font size="2"> 
  -- 4NT to ask for aces</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After you and partner have agreed 
  on a trump suit, a bid of 4NT is the Blackwood Convention, which asks partner 
  to tell you how many aces he holds. Partner responds with a 5-level bid that 
  shows the exact number of aces in his hand. The meanings of his responses are:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>5C</b> = None or all four 
      aces</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>5D</b> = One ace</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>5H</b> = Two aces</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>5S</b> = Three aces</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If <b><i>two aces</i></b> are 
  missing --&quot;sign off&quot; in 5 of your suit (or pass, if that was 
  partner's Blackwood response). If your agreed trump suit is clubs or diamonds 
  and you want to sign off in 5NT, bid 5S. This tells partner to bid 5NT, and 
  you will pass.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If <b><i>only one ace</i></b> is 
  missing -- you can bid six of your suit or notrump.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If your side holds <b><i>all four 
  aces</i></b> -- and if you think you may have the power to take all the tricks 
  -- you can try for a grand slam by bidding 5NT to ask for kings. This <b>guarantees 
  that your side holds all four aces</b> and asks partner how many kings he 
  holds. Partner will respond at the 6-level (using the same steps as above) to 
  show the number of kings he holds -- 6C to show none or four kings, 6D to show 
  three, etc.).<br>
  &nbsp;</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><b><u><font size="2">The Gerber Convention</font></u></b><font size="2"> 
  -- 4C to ask for aces</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The Gerber 4C Convention is used 
  to ask for aces after partner opens 1NT or 2NT, or after he opens one of a 
  suit and shows a specific point range by rebidding 1NT or 2NT. In these 
  specific situations, a jump to 4NT would <b><i>not</i></b> be Blackwood -- 
  it's a natural raise of notrump that invites partner to bid 6NT if he's at the 
  top of his point range. Partner can pass 4NT if he has a minimum notrump 
  opener or rebid.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A bid of 4C directly over 
  partner's notrump bid is Gerber and asks for aces. Partner's response tells 
  you how many aces he holds:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>4D = </b>None or all four 
      aces</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>4H = </b>One ace</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>4S</b> = Two aces</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>4NT</b> = Three aces</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If your side holds all four aces 
  and you want to investigate a grand slam, a bid of 5C guarantees you have all 
  four aces and asks for kings (just like a rebid of 5NT after Blackwood 4NT). 
  Partner will respond at the 5-level (using the same steps as above) to show 
  the number of kings he holds.<br>
  &nbsp;</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">General Guidelines for Using 
  Blackwood &amp; Gerber</font></b></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Don't chicken out if you find you 
  have only 3 aces. In most cases, if you don't have enough strength to bid a 
  slam missing only one ace, then you shouldn't be asking for aces.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Remember that Blackwood and Gerber 
  tell you only the <b><i>number</i></b> of aces partner has. They don't tell 
  you which suits they're in or whether you're off a cashing Ace-King in a suit. 
  You should only use Blackwood or Gerber when:</font>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You've already found a good a 
      trump suit (or agreed on notrump).</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You know you have the overall 
      strength for a slam.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your hand has controls in all <b><i>unbid</i></b> 
      suits (aces, kings or singletons).</font></li>
  </ol>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2"><i>DON'T</i> use Blackwood 
      or Gerber if:</font></b>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have a 
      void.<br>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have a worthless doubleton (xx, Qx, Jx) in an unbid 
      suit.<br>
      3.&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to know if partner has control of a <b><i>specific</i></b> 
      suit. To get this information, use a cuebidding sequence instead.</font></dd>
  </dl>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>The Cuebid</u></b> -- to 
  find specific aces</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">For hands where you can't use 
  Blackwood, you can investigate slam by &quot;cuebidding&quot;--bidding new 
  suits to show outside aces. Once you and partner have agreed on a trump suit, 
  a new-suit bid is not a search for a different trump suit. It is a shows a 
  specific outside ace and is a move toward slam in the suit you've already 
  chosen.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Once you and partner have 
  agreed on a trump suit, a new-suit bid by you shows a suit where you hold an 
  ace.</b> It asks partner to cooperate by bidding a suit where he holds an ace. 
  To save bidding room when you're cuebidding, both partners should always bid 
  the <b><i>cheapest</i></b> suit in which they have a control (an ace or a 
  void). You can also continue the cuebidding sequence to find a second-round 
  control (the king or a singleton). Here's an example:</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>AKJ74&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">Void&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">943&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">AKQ103</b></font>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You open 1S and partner bids 
      3S (a limit raise with 4 trumps). You want to bid 6S if partner has 
      control of diamonds, but you can't get this information with Blackwood (if 
      you bid 4NT and partner answers one ace, you won't know whether it's in 
      hearts or diamonds). To locate the diamond ace, you must start a 
      cuebidding sequence with 4C. If partner cuebids 4D, you'll know he has the 
      diamond ace and you can bid 6S.</font>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If partner instead cuebids 4H, 
      it tells you he has the heart ace but not the diamond ace (since he will 
      cuebid his cheapest ace). Over partner's 4H cuebid, you can sign off in 4S 
      if you are no longer interested in a slam, but this hand is strong enough 
      to continue the investigation. A 5C cuebid by you shows a second-round 
      control of clubs and asks partner to tell you more. Since partner's 4H 
      cuebid already denied the diamond ace, he can now cuebid 5D to show you a 
      second-round control (the king or a singleton). If he bids 5D, you'll bid 
      6S. If he bids 5H (showing second-round control of hearts but not 
      diamonds), you'll sign off in 5S. If he bids 5S (showing neither control), 
      you'll pass.</font></dd>
