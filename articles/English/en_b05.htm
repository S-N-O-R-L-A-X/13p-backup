  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Opening Leads: When to lead 
  trumps</font></h2>
  <hr width="100%">
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">On many hands, your choice of an 
  opening lead involves using clues from the auction to decide whether you 
  should make an aggressive lead, or play it safe with a passive lead. You'll 
  have a slightly different type of decision to make when you consider a trump 
  lead, which, depending on the auction and your hand, may be an aggressive <b><i>or 
  </i></b>a passive choice.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&quot;Aggressive&quot; trump 
  leads</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">On some hands, a trump lead can 
  actually be your strongest attack because it serves to shorten declarer's or 
  dummy's trump holding. The types of auctions that will give you the strongest 
  clues about this include those where:</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>(1) Declarer has shown a 
  two-suited hand,</b> especially if you have a good holding in declarer's other 
  suit. Many good players consider it virtually mandatory to lead a trump to an 
  auction like this one:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>West&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East
</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1H&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you hold&nbsp;<img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>10962&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ6&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">83&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ97</b>, 
  lead the diamond 3. It's a strong possibility that dummy will be relatively 
  short in declarer's second suit (clubs), and you expect declarer may try to 
  use dummy's diamonds to trump his club losers. Both opponents have shown 
  minimum hands, so they may not have enough in high-card power alone to make 
  their contract.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>(2) You expect the short-trump 
  hand (usually dummy) to be short in another suit.</b> You can almost see 
  dummy's singleton club after this auction:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>West&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East
</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1H&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1NT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4H
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opener's sequence here typically 
  shows some extra values with 3-card heart support. Since opener pulled partner 
  out of 1NT, you expect that he has an unbalanced pattern -- probably 4-3-5-1 
  -- and that the opponents are in a 5-3 fit. If you hold:<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>109&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">975&nbsp; 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ76&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">AK43</b> 
  ,<br>
  resist the temptation to cash a high club, which may give declarer the tempo 
  he needs to trump two club losers in dummy. You want to lead trumps as many 
  times as possible, so start with the heart 5. If declarer wants to set up 
  ruffs in dummy, he'll have to lead clubs himself, and you'll be in again for a 
  second trump lead.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>(3) You have a clear advantage 
  in overall power.</b> This may be especially important if you've doubled the 
  contract. After an auction like:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO
</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1NT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2S&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><i>All Pass</i></b></font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">a trump lead is a good idea, even 
  if you have an unattractive holding, such as:<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>Q92&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ10&nbsp; 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KQJ2&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">A103</b>.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Although partner should have a 
  fair spade holding, his double may have been partially based on his knowledge 
  that the two of you hold significantly more than half the high-card strength. 
  In this case, declarer's only prayer will be to score tricks with a few of 
  dummy's trumps. Every trump lead you make may cost him a trick.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>(4) You have a clear advantage 
  in trump length and/or strength.</b> In this auction:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>RHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; <b><i>All Pass</i></b></font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">partner rates to have better 
  trumps than declarer, so you'll want to attack declarer's holding. You may 
  even be able to draw all of declarer's and dummy's trumps. This is one of the 
  rare exceptions to the &quot;rule&quot; about never leading a singleton trump.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&quot;Passive&quot; trump leads</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">On some hands, you may be reduced 
  to leading a trump just because nothing else looks safe. After a 1S-2S auction 
  by your opponents, you have an unattractive choice of leads from:<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>754&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A1072&nbsp; 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ32&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">J4</b> 
  .</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">All the unbid suits look 
  dangerous, so try the spade 4. You don't necessarily expect this to hurt 
  declarer, but you hope it won't help. Since partner has only one or two 
  trumps, probably the worst that can happen is that you'll find his doubleton 
  queen -- and that's something declarer may have found for himself anyway.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A few warnings:</b> When in 
  doubt, <b><i>avoid leading a trump</i></b> if you hold:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A singleton trump. </b>Your 
      shortness suggests partner has length, and this lead will often pick up 
      any honors he might have. It's better to lead a long suit and try to force 
      declarer to trump himself down to the same or shorter length than your 
      partner.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A &quot;dangerous&quot; 
      honor holding </b>like Jxx,&nbsp; Jx,&nbsp; K10x,&nbsp; A10x&nbsp; or&nbsp; 
      Ax. These will be safe only if partner holds no honors in the trump suit. 
      If he has the jack or queen, a lead from one of these combinations can 
      make one of your natural trump tricks disappear immediately. Or, more 
      likely, it will give declarer a finessing position that will let him pick 
      up the suit on the next lead.</font></li>
