    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">On many hands, your choice of an
        opening lead involves using clues from the auction to decide whether you
        should make an aggressive lead, or play it safe with a passive lead. You'll
        have a slightly different type of decision to make when you consider a trump
        lead, which, depending on the auction and your hand, may be an aggressive <b><i>or
          </i></b>a passive choice.</font>

        leads</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">On some hands, a trump lead can
        actually be your strongest attack because it serves to shorten declarer's or
        dummy's trump holding. The types of auctions that will give you the strongest
        clues about this include those where:</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>(1) Declarer has shown a
          two-suited hand,</b> especially if you have a good holding in declarer's other
        suit. Many good players consider it virtually mandatory to lead a trump to an
        auction like this one:</font>
    <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>West&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East
</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1H&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass</font></pre>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If you hold&nbsp;<img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>10962&nbsp;<img alt="H-"
            src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ6&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">83&nbsp;<img

        lead the diamond 3. It's a strong possibility that dummy will be relatively
        short in declarer's second suit (clubs), and you expect declarer may try to
        use dummy's diamonds to trump his club losers. Both opponents have shown
        minimum hands, so they may not have enough in high-card power alone to make
        their contract.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>(2) You expect the short-trump
          hand (usually dummy) to be short in another suit.</b> You can almost see
        dummy's singleton club after this auction:</font>
    <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>West&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East
</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1H&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1NT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4H
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass</font></pre>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Opener's sequence here typically
        shows some extra values with 3-card heart support. Since opener pulled partner
        out of 1NT, you expect that he has an unbalanced pattern -- probably 4-3-5-1
        -- and that the opponents are in a 5-3 fit. If you hold:<br>
        <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>109&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13"
            height="11">975&nbsp;
          <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ76&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13"
            height="11">AK43</b>
        ,<br>
        resist the temptation to cash a high club, which may give declarer the tempo
        he needs to trump two club losers in dummy. You want to lead trumps as many
        times as possible, so start with the heart 5. If declarer wants to set up
        ruffs in dummy, he'll have to lead clubs himself, and you'll be in again for a
        second trump lead.
      </font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>(3) You have a clear advantage
          in overall power.</b> This may be especially important if you've doubled the
        contract. After an auction like:</font>
    <pre
      style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">a trump lead is a good idea, even
        if you have an unattractive holding, such as:<br>
        <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>Q92&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13"

            height="11">A103</b>.
      </font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Although partner should have a
        fair spade holding, his double may have been partially based on his knowledge
        that the two of you hold significantly more than half the high-card strength.
        In this case, declarer's only prayer will be to score tricks with a few of
        dummy's trumps. Every trump lead you make may cost him a trick.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>(4) You have a clear advantage
          in trump length and/or strength.</b> In this auction:</font>

      <font size="2">partner rates to have better
        trumps than declarer, so you'll want to attack declarer's holding. You may
        even be able to draw all of declarer's and dummy's trumps. This is one of the
        rare exceptions to the &quot;rule&quot; about never leading a singleton trump.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">&quot;Passive&quot; trump leads</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">On some hands, you may be reduced
        to leading a trump just because nothing else looks safe. After a 1S-2S auction
        by your opponents, you have an unattractive choice of leads from:<br>
        <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>754&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13"

        .
      </font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">All the unbid suits look
        dangerous, so try the spade 4. You don't necessarily expect this to hurt
        declarer, but you hope it won't help. Since partner has only one or two
        trumps, probably the worst that can happen is that you'll find his doubleton
        queen -- and that's something declarer may have found for himself anyway.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>A few warnings:</b> When in
        doubt, <b><i>avoid leading a trump</i></b> if you hold:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A singleton trump. </b>Your
            shortness suggests partner has length, and this lead will often pick up
            any honors he might have. It's better to lead a long suit and try to force
            declarer to trump himself down to the same or shorter length than your
            partner.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A &quot;dangerous&quot;
              honor holding </b>like Jxx,&nbsp; Jx,&nbsp; K10x,&nbsp; A10x&nbsp; or&nbsp;
            Ax. These will be safe only if partner holds no honors in the trump suit.
            If he has the jack or queen, a lead from one of these combinations can
            make one of your natural trump tricks disappear immediately. Or, more
            likely, it will give declarer a finessing position that will let him pick
            up the suit on the next lead.</font>
      </li>
