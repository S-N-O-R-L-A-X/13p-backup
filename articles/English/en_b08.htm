  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Negative Doubles</font></h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Negative doubles have become 
  popular because they solve this difficult -- and common -- bidding problem:</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><strong>762 
      &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ75 &nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">94 
      &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ93</strong></font>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Partner opens 1D and your 
      right-hand opponent (RHO) overcalls 1S. The overcall has taken away your 
      1H response, so you have no way to accurately describe your strength and 
      distribution. You can't bid 1NT (which promises a spade stopper) and you 
      can't bid a new suit at the 2-level (which promises 10-11+ pts.).</font></dd>
  </dl>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This solution is the <i><b>negative 
  double.</b></i> To use this convention, you and partner agree that if you open 
  the bidding and the opponent makes a direct suit overcall, a double by 
  responder is <i><b>NOT</b></i> for penalty. Instead, it shows:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">At least a fair response (7+ 
      pts.) <i><b>AND</b></i></font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>4-card length</strong> 
      in at least one of the unbid suits -- usually the unbid<b> <i>major</i></b> 
      suit. (Some pairs agree that if the two unbid suits are majors -- for 
      example, after 1C by partner, 1D by RHO -- a negative double promises 4 
      cards in <strong><i>both </i></strong>suits.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In the problem above, you would 
  double to show the values for a response and a 4-card heart suit. This tells 
  partner that you would have responded 1H if the opponent had passed. If opener 
  also has 4 hearts, he'll &quot;raise&quot; your response by bidding hearts 
  himself. If not, he can choose another descriptive bid.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here are some other examples of 
  how you can use negative doubles:</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><strong>A973 
      &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">92 
      &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ1062</strong></font>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If partner opens 1D and RHO 
      overcalls 1H, make a negative double</b>. Even though you have enough 
      strength for a 2-level freebid, a 2C bid here will make it difficult to 
      find a possible 4-4 spade fit. Use the double to show your 4-card spade 
      suit, then decide which game to bid over partner's response. If partner 
      doesn't &quot;raise&quot; your spades, you'll bid 3NT.</font></dd>

    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If partner opens 1D and RHO 
      overcalls 2C, make a negative double </b>to show at least one 4-card 
      major. If partner bids 2H, you can bid 2NT -- this shows an 
      invitational-to-game hand with a club stopper, but without four hearts. 
      Since you started with the negative double instead of 2NT, partner will 
      also know that you have a 4-card spade suit.</font></dd>

  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responder's Freebids</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Playing negative doubles also 
  offers you the advantage of assigning a more specific meaning to a freebid of 
  a new suit. After an opponent's overcall, if responder freely bids a new suit 
  (instead of making a negative double), he promises a <i><b>5-card suit</b></i>. 
  A new-suit freebid at the 1-level shows 7+ pts.; at the 2-level or higher, it 
  shows 10+ pts.</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><strong>QJ1073 
      &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">874 &nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">A92 
      &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">74</strong></font>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If partner opens 1D and your 
      RHO overcalls 1H, bid 1S. The overcall hasn't taken away your 1-level 
      response, so you have <strong><i>two </i></strong>ways to show spades In 
      these situations, use the negative double to show a <strong>4-card</strong> 
      suit. Use the freebid (1S) to promise a <strong>5-card</strong> suit 
      (partner will know he can raise with 3-card support). <strong><i>However,</i></strong> 
      if partner opens 1D and your RHO overcalls 2C, this hand isn't strong 
      enough for a 2S freebid. In this case, you'll have to use a negative 
      double. If partner bids 2D, you'll pass. If he bids 2H, you can correct to 
      2S, which shows extra length and is not forcing.</font></dd>

  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Penalizing the opponent's 
  overcall</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">What do you do when you have a 
  &quot;real&quot; penalty double of RHO's overcall? As responder, you can't 
  make an immediate double for penalty, so you must pass and hope partner will 
  bid again:</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><strong>3 
      &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">Q43 &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ1087 
      &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">A754</strong></font>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If partner opens 1S and your 
      RHO overcalls 2D, your only alternative is to pass (smoothly) and let 
      partner bid for you. If partner is short in diamonds (very likely), he'll 
      reopen with a takeout double. You can pass this double for penalties.</font></dd>
  </dl>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When is the negative double 
  &quot;off&quot;?</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You and your partner can decide at 
  which levels of bidding you'll use negative doubles. One popular agreement is 
  that negative doubles are &quot;on&quot; if the opponent makes a suit overcall 
  through the level of 3S. If you use this agreement, negative doubles are 
  &quot;off&quot; (responder's double is for penalty) if the overcall is 4C or 
  higher.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">No matter how you choose to play 
  negative doubles, they apply only if the opponent overcalls a<strong><i> suit</i></strong>. 
  Responder's double of a 1NT overcall is always for penalty.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The higher the level of the 
  overcall, the more strength responder needs to make a negative double. If 
  partner opens 1C and the opponent makes a jump overcall of 2S, you'll want to 
  have a little extra playing strength (not necessarily extra points) to make a 
  negative double, which will force partner to the 3-level.</font>

  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opener's rebids</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After responder's negative double, 
  opener must make a rebid that describes both his strength and his support for 
  the suit partner has shown with the double. In most cases, you'll bid your 
  hand just as if partner had made a 1-bid in that suit:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With a <b>MINIMUM </b>opening 
      (13-15 pts.), make your natural suit or notrump rebid at a low level. If 
      you have 4-card support for the suit partner has shown with the double, 
      you should always show it.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With an <b>INVITATIONAL</b> 
      hand (15-17 pts.), <i><b>jump</b> <b>one</b> <b>level</b></i> to show 
      extra strength (1C by you - 1H overcall - DBL by partner - P - <i><b>2S</b></i> 
      by you).</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With a <b>FORCING-TO-GAME</b> 
      hand (18+ pts.), <i><b>jump to game</b></i>. (Or, if you're not sure of 
      which game to play, <i><b>cuebid</b></i> the opponent's suit to force 
      responder to tell you more about his hand.)</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><br>
  </font><strong><u><font size="2">Reopening the bidding</font></u></strong>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Remember that responder cannot 
  make an immediate penalty double of an opponent's overcall. If you open the 
  bidding, your LHO makes an overcall and your partner passes, he may have a 
  hand with strength in the opponent's suit. If you're short in the overcaller's 
  suit, you should try to &quot;protect&quot; partner by reopening the bidding 
  for him.</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><strong>AJ9

      &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">9</strong></font>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You open 1D, your LHO 
      overcalls 2C, and it goes Pass-Pass back to you. You should keep the 
      auction open with a balancing double, which is takeout. If partner wanted 
      to make a penalty double of 2C, he can pass. If he didn't, he'll bid 2D, 
      2H or 2S.</font></dd>
  </dl>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Be careful</b> about reopening, 
  though, if you have length in the opponent's suit:</font>
  <dl>

      &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">10754</strong></font>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You open 1D, your LHO 
      overcalls 2C, and it goes Pass-Pass back to you. With this hand, you 
      should pass. Your club length tells you partner wasn't waiting to make a 
      penalty double of 2C. It's more likely he passed because he's very weak. 
      Your shortness in the majors should make you suspicious that the opponents 
      have a better trump suit, so don't give them a chance to find it.</font></dd>
