      <font size="2">Negative doubles have become
        popular because they solve this difficult -- and common -- bidding problem:</font>

          <font size="2">Partner opens 1D and your
            right-hand opponent (RHO) overcalls 1S. The overcall has taken away your
            1H response, so you have no way to accurately describe your strength and
            distribution. You can't bid 1NT (which promises a spade stopper) and you
            can't bid a new suit at the 2-level (which promises 10-11+ pts.).</font>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This solution is the <i><b>negative
            double.</b></i> To use this convention, you and partner agree that if you open
        the bidding and the opponent makes a direct suit overcall, a double by
        responder is <i><b>NOT</b></i> for penalty. Instead, it shows:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">At least a fair response (7+
            pts.) <i><b>AND</b></i></font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><strong>4-card length</strong>
            in at least one of the unbid suits -- usually the unbid<b> <i>major</i></b>
            suit. (Some pairs agree that if the two unbid suits are majors -- for
            example, after 1C by partner, 1D by RHO -- a negative double promises 4
            cards in <strong><i>both </i></strong>suits.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In the problem above, you would
        double to show the values for a response and a 4-card heart suit. This tells
        partner that you would have responded 1H if the opponent had passed. If opener
        also has 4 hearts, he'll &quot;raise&quot; your response by bidding hearts
        himself. If not, he can choose another descriptive bid.</font>

          <font size="2"><b>If partner opens 1D and RHO
              overcalls 1H, make a negative double</b>. Even though you have enough
            strength for a 2-level freebid, a 2C bid here will make it difficult to
            find a possible 4-4 spade fit. Use the double to show your 4-card spade
            suit, then decide which game to bid over partner's response. If partner
            doesn't &quot;raise&quot; your spades, you'll bid 3NT.</font>

            invitational-to-game hand with a club stopper, but without four hearts.
            Since you started with the negative double instead of 2NT, partner will
            also know that you have a 4-card spade suit.</font>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Playing negative doubles also
        offers you the advantage of assigning a more specific meaning to a freebid of
        a new suit. After an opponent's overcall, if responder freely bids a new suit
        (instead of making a negative double), he promises a <i><b>5-card suit</b></i>.
        A new-suit freebid at the 1-level shows 7+ pts.; at the 2-level or higher, it
        shows 10+ pts.</font>

            these situations, use the negative double to show a <strong>4-card</strong>
            suit. Use the freebid (1S) to promise a <strong>5-card</strong> suit
            (partner will know he can raise with 3-card support). <strong><i>However,</i></strong>
            if partner opens 1D and your RHO overcalls 2C, this hand isn't strong
            enough for a 2S freebid. In this case, you'll have to use a negative
            double. If partner bids 2D, you'll pass. If he bids 2H, you can correct to
            2S, which shows extra length and is not forcing.</font>

    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">You and your partner can decide at
        which levels of bidding you'll use negative doubles. One popular agreement is
        that negative doubles are &quot;on&quot; if the opponent makes a suit overcall
        through the level of 3S. If you use this agreement, negative doubles are
        &quot;off&quot; (responder's double is for penalty) if the overcall is 4C or
        higher.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">No matter how you choose to play
        negative doubles, they apply only if the opponent overcalls a<strong><i> suit</i></strong>.
        Responder's double of a 1NT overcall is always for penalty.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The higher the level of the
        overcall, the more strength responder needs to make a negative double. If
        partner opens 1C and the opponent makes a jump overcall of 2S, you'll want to
        have a little extra playing strength (not necessarily extra points) to make a
        negative double, which will force partner to the 3-level.</font>

      <font size="2">After responder's negative double,
        opener must make a rebid that describes both his strength and his support for
