    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Overcalls should promise a
            better suit, more high-card points and more playing strength than
            non-vulnerable overcalls. Be sure you have a long, strong suit, especially
            if you bid at the 2-level or higher.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Preempts (opening 3-bids,
            4-bids and weak jump overcalls) should be very sound. A good rule to
            follow is to be within two tricks of your bid -- your hand should have
            enough playing strength that you expect to go down no more than two tricks
            if partner contributes little or nothing.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">&quot;Stretch&quot; a little
            to bid your games. If you think you have the strength for a game contract,
            go ahead and bid it.</font>

    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Overcalls can be made with
            weaker hands (as few as 9 pts. at the 1-level). The better your suit, the
            fewer points you need to make an overcall.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Preempts can be
            &quot;light&quot; -- a hand with playing strength that is within three
            tricks of your bid (6 playing tricks for an opening 3-bid).</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">If you and your partner have a
            good trump fit, you should compete aggressively. Don't make it easy for
            your opponents to bid their game and win the rubber. The penalties for
            going down in your contract can be relatively small, but your loss if the
            opponents bid game are high -- 700 points for the rubber bonus, plus the
            value of their game.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">This is usually the only time
            a rubber-bridge player will consider making a sacrifice bid -- a contract
            that you know is going down, but that you hope will cost less than the
            value of your opponents' game.</font>

      <font size="2">If you have a partscore on:</font>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Opening bids can be
            &quot;light&quot; (10-12 pts.) if you have a good suit. It may be
            important to get your suit into the auction before the opponents bid.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">If you have a good trump fit,
            &quot;stretch&quot; a little to bid up to the level you need to complete
            the part score.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">To be sure you complete your
            partscore, both responder and opener should be fairly conservative. Keep
            the auction low if you have a minimum to intermediate hand (12-16 pts. for
            opener, 5-12 pts. for responder). If partner opens the bidding, however,
            responder may want to stretch a little to get to the minimum level needed
            for the partscore.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">If you have a stronger hand,
            try to show your extra power by bidding up to the level you know is
            &quot;safe&quot;, even if it's higher than you need to bid to complete the
            partscore. This may be important in finding a possible slam.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Once you and partner have
            found a trump fit, any <strong><i>free bid</i></strong> past the level you
            need to complete the part score shows a hand interested in a slam. A free
            bid is one made over an opponent's pass; a <strong><i>competitive bid</i></strong>
            is one made because the opponent's bid pushed you a level higher.</font>

        <font size="2"><strong>Example:</strong> &nbsp;
          If you have 60 &quot;on&quot; (you need 40 to complete your game) and
          partner opens 1H, here are some loose guidelines responder might follow:</font>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p style="line-height: 100%">
            <font size="2">A single raise (1H-<strong>2H</strong>)
              or a bid of 1NT shows from 5 to 12 pts.</font>
        <li>
          <p style="line-height: 100%">
            <font size="2">A jump-raise (1H-<strong>3H</strong>)
              or a jump to 2NT promises a stronger hand (13-16 &quot;playing
              pts.&quot;) that may make slam if partner has extra for his opening bid.</font>
        <li>
          <p style="line-height: 100%">
            <font size="2">A jump to game (1H-<strong>4H</strong>)
              shows powerful trumps and a very strong hand that has excellent slam
              potential, even if opener has a minimum.</font>
        <li>
          <p style="line-height: 100%">
            <font size="2">A jump in a new suit (1H-<strong>3C</strong>)
              shows a long, strong suit and a very powerful hand (18-19+ pts.).</font>
