  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you're vulnerable:</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Overcalls should promise a 
      better suit, more high-card points and more playing strength than 
      non-vulnerable overcalls. Be sure you have a long, strong suit, especially 
      if you bid at the 2-level or higher.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Preempts (opening 3-bids, 
      4-bids and weak jump overcalls) should be very sound. A good rule to 
      follow is to be within two tricks of your bid -- your hand should have 
      enough playing strength that you expect to go down no more than two tricks 
      if partner contributes little or nothing.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&quot;Stretch&quot; a little 
      to bid your games. If you think you have the strength for a game contract, 
      go ahead and bid it.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you're NOT vulnerable and your 
  opponents ARE vulnerable:</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Overcalls can be made with 
      weaker hands (as few as 9 pts. at the 1-level). The better your suit, the 
      fewer points you need to make an overcall.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Preempts can be 
      &quot;light&quot; -- a hand with playing strength that is within three 
      tricks of your bid (6 playing tricks for an opening 3-bid).</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you and your partner have a 
      good trump fit, you should compete aggressively. Don't make it easy for 
      your opponents to bid their game and win the rubber. The penalties for 
      going down in your contract can be relatively small, but your loss if the 
      opponents bid game are high -- 700 points for the rubber bonus, plus the 
      value of their game.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This is usually the only time 
      a rubber-bridge player will consider making a sacrifice bid -- a contract 
      that you know is going down, but that you hope will cost less than the 
      value of your opponents' game.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you have a partscore on:</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opening bids can be 
      &quot;light&quot; (10-12 pts.) if you have a good suit. It may be 
      important to get your suit into the auction before the opponents bid.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you have a good trump fit, 
      &quot;stretch&quot; a little to bid up to the level you need to complete 
      the part score.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">To be sure you complete your 
      partscore, both responder and opener should be fairly conservative. Keep 
      the auction low if you have a minimum to intermediate hand (12-16 pts. for 
      opener, 5-12 pts. for responder). If partner opens the bidding, however, 
      responder may want to stretch a little to get to the minimum level needed 
      for the partscore.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you have a stronger hand, 
      try to show your extra power by bidding up to the level you know is 
      &quot;safe&quot;, even if it's higher than you need to bid to complete the 
      partscore. This may be important in finding a possible slam.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Once you and partner have 
      found a trump fit, any <strong><i>free bid</i></strong> past the level you 
      need to complete the part score shows a hand interested in a slam. A free 
      bid is one made over an opponent's pass; a <strong><i>competitive bid</i></strong> 
      is one made because the opponent's bid pushed you a level higher.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Example:</strong> &nbsp; 
    If you have 60 &quot;on&quot; (you need 40 to complete your game) and 
    partner opens 1H, here are some loose guidelines responder might follow:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A single raise (1H-<strong>2H</strong>) 
        or a bid of 1NT shows from 5 to 12 pts.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A jump-raise (1H-<strong>3H</strong>) 
        or a jump to 2NT promises a stronger hand (13-16 &quot;playing 
        pts.&quot;) that may make slam if partner has extra for his opening bid.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A jump to game (1H-<strong>4H</strong>) 
        shows powerful trumps and a very strong hand that has excellent slam 
        potential, even if opener has a minimum.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A jump in a new suit (1H-<strong>3C</strong>) 
        shows a long, strong suit and a very powerful hand (18-19+ pts.).</font></li>
    </ul>
