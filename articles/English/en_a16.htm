  led the suit):</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Play <b>&quot;Third Hand 
      High&quot;</b> rule to set up potential tricks for your side. Play the 
      highest card necessary to force declarer or dummy to win with its high 
      card.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Always play the <i><b>lowest 
      of touching cards</b></i> to give partner the most information about your 
      strength. (Play the J from QJx; the 9 from J109.)</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you're playing after dummy, 
      be sure to <b>bracket</b> your honors if dummy plays low. (Play the J from 
      KJx if dummy plays low from Qxx.)</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you're Second Hand (declarer 
  or dummy is leading the suit):</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If an honor is led and you're 
      next to play, follow the <b>&quot;Cover-an-Honor with-an-Honor&quot;</b> 
      rule -- if declarer or dummy leads an honor (10 through Ace), play your 
      higher honor on it if you have one. This forces declarer to use two of his 
      honors to capture one of yours.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With most other holdings, 
      follow the <b>&quot;Second-Hand Low&quot;</b> rule -- if you're in doubt 
      about which card to play, choose a low card. The main exceptions to this 
      rule are:</font></li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>1 - </b>You have a sequence 
    of honors (KQJx, QJ10xx, etc.) and want to be sure you force declarer to win 
    a high card. In this case, play the <i><b>lowest</b></i> of your touching 
    honors.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>2 - </b>You're covering an 
    honor with an honor, or playing your ace to win a king or queen.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>3 - </b>You're reasonably 
    sure your ace will be trumped later if you don't take it now.</font>

  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you're on lead after the first 
  trick:</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If partner made the opening 
      lead -- and if you're in doubt about what to do when you gain the lead 
      later in the hand -- return partner's suit. This is an especially valuable 
      guideline to follow when defending notrump contracts.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you want to switch suits, 
      choose to lead <i><b>through</b></i> strength and <i><b>up</b> <b>to</b></i> 
      weakness. Ideally, you want the opponent who holds the most strength in a 
      suit to be the <i><b>second</b></i> hand to play to the trick. You want 
      the hand with weakness in the suit to be <i><b>fourth</b></i> to play to 
      the trick.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Don't be afraid to lead a suit 
      that you know declarer will trump -- you can sometimes weaken his trump 
      holding by doing so.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Don't be afraid to lead a 
      trump. If it appears that your other possible leads will risk giving 
      declarer a trick, a trump can sometimes serve as a safe exit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Don't</strong> lead a 
      suit if <i><b>both</b></i> declarer and dummy are void. This is called a 
      &quot;ruff -and-sluff&quot;, and it often gives up trick by letting 
      declarer trump in one hand and throw a loser from the other hand.<br>

  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Count and Attitude Signals</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">To defend a bridge hand well, you 
  need to be alert to -- and be able to process -- all the clues that are 
  available. Some clues come from the bidding, which often gives you a general 
  picture of who holds the length and strength in each suit. Your best source of 
  information, though, is your partner, who can give you <strong>Attitude and 
  Count Signals</strong> during the play. These signals are used by both 
  defenders to exchange information about their length and honor holding in each 
  suit. Here's how they work:</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><strong><u><font size="2">Attitude Signals</font></u></strong>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can tell partner whether 
      or not you &quot;like&quot; a suit by the size of the card you play when 
      discarding the suit <i><b>or</b></i> when following suit to a trick you 
      are not winning. A high card is a &quot;come-on&quot; signal -- it tells 
      partner you have a possible trick in the suit (you have a high honor, or 
      will be able to trump the third round of the suit) and that he should lead 
      it again. A low card tells him you have no potential tricks in the suit 
      (no honors, no shortness) and that he should consider leading a different 
      suit.</font></dd>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><strong><u><font size="2">Count Signals</font></u></strong>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When following suit or 
      discarding, playing <i><b>high, then low</b></i> in the same suit tells 
      partner you have an <i><b>even</b></i> number of cards in that suit. 
      Playing <i><b>low, then high</b></i> shows an <i><b>odd</b></i> number of 
      cards. If you're defending a suit contract, this signal tells partner 
      whether or not you can trump the third round of a suit. In suit and 
      notrump contracts, your count signal also helps partner determine how many 
      cards declarer holds in the suit. This can be very valuable information if 
      partner needs to know how long he should hold up winning an ace, for 
      example.</font></dd>
