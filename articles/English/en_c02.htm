  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Part 1 -- Responder's First Bid</font></h3>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Called &quot;a modern solution to 
  a common bidding problem&quot; by the <i>Encyclopedia of Bridge</i>, the 
  Negative Freebid has become a popular addition to many partnerships' systems. 
  Whether you and your partner decide to use this bid or not, it's likely you'll 
  be playing pairs who do, so it's a good idea to arm yourself with some 
  information.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The Negative Freebid is not really 
  a convention (all of responder's and opener's bids are natural) but is best 
  classified as a bidding treatment or agreement. When using Negative Freebids, 
  you and partner agree to lower the point requirements for some of responder's 
  freebids in competitive auctions. This increases responder's ability to show a 
  long suit after an opponent overcalls and improves your chances of finding a 
  fit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The &quot;problem&quot; with  
  standard freebids</font></h3> 
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Consider this typical situation. 
  Partner opens 1D, your RHO overcalls 1S, and you hold:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><strong>53

    <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KQJ103</strong></font>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With standard methods, a new-suit 
  bid at the two-level would promise at least 11 points (perhaps a good 10). 
  Neither of these hands is strong enough to bid your suit freely, so what do 
  you do?</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>With Hand #1,</b> the usual 
  solution is to make a negative double. Since partner will seldom be kind 
  enough to bid hearts, you plan on bidding 2H over his expected rebid of 1NT, 
  2C or 2D.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">But what if LHO raises his 
  partner's spade suit? When the auction is passed back to you, you'll have 
  another dilemma-pass and lose a possible partscore, or risk a 3H bid, which 
  could be a disaster if partner doesn't have a suitable trump holding.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>With Hand #2,</b> the negative 
  double isn't even an option. You're more or less &quot;stuck&quot; with 
  passing and hoping you can show your hand later. If LHO raises his partner's 
  spade overcall, you may be shut out forever.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Even if LHO passes and partner 
  reopens with a double, you have no good way to describe this hand. A jump to 
  3C would show some values, but virtually promises a 6-card suit. And 2C is 
  somewhat of an underbid, since you have a considerably better suit and hand 
  than partner might expect.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The Negative-Freebid Solution</font></h3> 
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The Negative Freebid (NFB) allows 
  you to make your natural response with hands like those above, but without 
  promising game-invitational values or catapulting the auction too high.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A NFB is used when an opponent 
  overcalls your side's opening bid and responder has a long suit that cannot be 
  shown at the one-level. In the examples above, you would make a NFB of 2H with 
  Hand #1 and 2C with Hand #2.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responder's Use of the Negative  
  Freebid</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responder's NFB is always a 
  non-jump, new-suit bid between 2C and 3D. It is an alertable bid that shows:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A good suit-a 6+-card suit or 
      a strong 5-carder.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">5-11 points.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If partner opened 1H or 1S, no 
      3-card or longer support for partner's suit.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some pairs prefer to play NFBs 
  through 3S, but this can create some very awkward auctions when responder 
  holds a strong hand. More often, you'll want to use the 3H and 3S bids to show 
  forcing hands.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><i><b>Remember:</b></i> These 
  freebids are called &quot;negative&quot; because they're non-forcing. They 
  are, however, intended as constructive; they show good suits and good playing 
  values.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responder's new-suit bid is <i><b>NOT</b></i> 
  a NFB if the bid is made:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">At a level of 3H or higher. If 
      partner opens 1S and your RHO overcalls 3D, no Negative Freebid is 
      available; your new-suit bid of 3H or 4C is forcing.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">At the one-level. Responder's 
      new-suit bid at the one-level carries the standard meaning. After 1D by 
      partner, 1H by RHO, a freebid of 1S is unlimited, showing 6+ points and a 
      5+-card suit (since you would make a negative double if you held only 4 
      spades).</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Much of your success with this 
  system depends on your hand evaluation skills. Remember that a Negative 
  Freebid tends to tell partner you have a one-suited hand without features that 
  would be more valuable in other contracts. Your choice of whether or not to 
  use the NFB, then, depends not just on your high-card values and suit quality, 
  but on your outside holdings. The vulnerability and the form of scoring may 
  also affect your decision (you'll usually want to be more conservative at IMPs).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Try your judgment with the 
  following hands:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">     <u>Partner   RHO    You</u>

      strong 6-carder and can do so at the 3-level) or by supporting partner's 
      minor, which you would want to do with this hand. If partner doesn't raise

  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Part 2 -- Other System Changes</font></h3>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Negative Freebids (NFB's) are 
  growing in popularity because they allow responder to make more natural, 
  non-forcing bids, which improves your chances of finding a fit. Adding this to 
  your system is simple enough-all you have to remember is that in competitive 
  auctions, responder's new-suit bids between 2C and 3D are not forcing. They 
  show 5-11 points and a long suit (6+-cards, or a very strong 5-carder).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Obviously, this agreement affects 
  the way you'll bid your stronger hands, so you also need to adjust the 
  meanings of some other bids. The two main changes involve negative doubles and 
  responder's jump shifts in competition.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Negative Double Auctions</font></h3> 
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Since responder's freebids through 
  3D are not forcing, you need a way to show a long suit and forcing-to-game 
  values. To do this, responder must use the negative double to start the 
  description of all strong hands with long suits. After opener's response to 
  the negative double, any new-suit bid by responder then shows a 5+-card suit 
  and is forcing to game.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Adding Negative Freebids to your 
  system does not change the way you bid your &quot;normal&quot; negative double 
  hands. As responder, you still use the negative double to describe hands of 
  limited high-card strength. The meaning of your negative double is changed <i><b>only</b></i> 
  if you rebid a new suit later.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After 1D by partner, 1S by RHO, 
  you would make a negative double with each of these hands:</font>

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">For the time being, opener will 
  assume your negative double is standard and he'll make his &quot;normal&quot; 
  response. You'll then clarify your hand type with your second bid.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>With Hand #1,</b> you have a 
  &quot;normal&quot; negative double and you'll bid this hand as if you were 
  playing Standard. If partner shows a minimum (with a rebid of 1NT, 2C, 2D or 
  2H), you'll bid 3NT. This auction guarantees 4 hearts, so if partner has 
  4-card support, he'll usually correct to 4H.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>With Hand #2,</b> you plan to 
  rebid a minimum number of clubs over partner's response. You won't need to 
  cuebid-the negative double followed by your new-suit bid shows a forcing hand. 
  Depending on partner's rebid after you show your clubs, you can now cuebid to 
  show extra strength and try for slam. 6C, 6D or even 6NT are likely contracts.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>With Hand #3,</b> you'll bid 2H 
  if partner rebids 1NT, 2C or 2D. Your new-suit bid doesn't promise any minimum 
  suit quality-it merely shows that you have a forcing-to-game hand with 5 or 
  more hearts. If partner doesn't raise hearts, you'll settle for 3NT.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>With Hand #4,</b> you'll also 
  bid 2H after your negative double, but here you plan to insist on a heart 
  game. Note that even though this hand's point-count falls into the 5-11 HCP 
  range for a NFB, it has the playing strength of an opening bid. A diamond or 
  heart slam is a strong possibility, so show your strength by starting with the 
  negative double. Don't risk partner passing a NFB of 2H (or even a jump to 3H, 
  which is described below).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responder's Jump-Shift in  
  Competition</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">So far, we've covered the ways 
  responder can show a long suit with a relatively weak hand and with a forcing 
  hand. With the Negative Freebid system, you can also show a third hand 
  type-one that's at the top of the NFB point-range and has a very strong suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">To show this highly invitational 
  hand, responder jump-shifts after an opponent overcalls. The jump in a new 
  suit shows:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A strong 6+-card suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Game-invitational values 
      (10-11 playing pts.)</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After partner opens 1D and RHO 
  overcalls 1S, you would jump to 3H with <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">J3

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opener is now well placed to 
  evaluate chances for game. Since he knows you don't have great high-card 
  strength outside your suit, he can pass with a &quot;soft&quot; 13 or 14 
  points. With good quick tricks and/or a fit, he can bid game, even with a bare 
  minimum opener.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responder's Cuebids</font></h3> 
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The negative double starts the 
  description of strong hands that have length in an unbid suit. If you just 
  want to show strength with support <i><b>for partner's suit</b></i>, there's 
  no need to start with a negative double -- use a direct cuebid instead.</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If partner opens a major</b> 
      and an opponent overcalls, you can cuebid with virtually any distribution 
      that includes support for opener's suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If partner opens a minor</b> 
      and an opponent overcalls, your cuebid denies 4+-card length in an unbid 
      major. If you have a major suit, use the negative double first to check 
      for a 4-4 fit. You can then cuebid to show support for partner's suit 
      later.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Depending on your preferences, 
  responder's immediate cuebid need not be forcing to game. The modern, and most 
  effective, treatment is to use the direct cuebid to show <i><b>limit-raise 
  values or better</b></i>. Your jump-raise in competition (1H by partner - 1S 
  by RHO - <b>3H</b> by you), then, is preemptive. After responder's cuebid, 
  opener must show <i><b>his</b></i> strength with his rebid. Opener retreats to 
  3 of his suit to show a hand that wouldn't have accepted a limit raise; he 
  makes any other bid to show a game acceptance.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">So what does the opening bidder do 
  with all this information? In the final article in this series, we'll discuss 
  the meanings of opener's rebids and ways he can evaluate his hand.</font>

  Freebids like because they make it easier for responder to show his long suit

  you'll need to choose a rebid that describes your strength and fit for 
  partner's suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If your RHO passes</b> your 
  partner's NFB, the meanings of your rebids are:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Pass -- </b>a minimum with 
      no interest in higher contracts. Passing does not promise a fit, so if you 
      have a minimum with poor support, don't &quot;run&quot; to 2NT.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Rebid of your first suit</b> 
      (1D-1S-2H-Pass-<b>3D</b>) -- not forcing, showing a minimum with a long, 
      strong suit <i><b>and</b></i> no fit for partner's suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>2NT</b> (1D-1S-2H-Pass-<b>2NT</b>) 
      -- Invitational high-card strength (16-18 pts.) with stoppers in the 
      opponent's suit. This usually denies a good fit for partner's suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A free raise of partner's 
      suit</b> (1D-1S-2H-Pass-<b>3H</b>) -- game invitational, showing a fitting 
      hand worth about 15-18 playing points. Since partner has promised a strong 
      suit, a fit may be a good doubleton or better.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Jump to game in partner's 
      suit</b> (1D-1S-2H-Pass-<b>4H</b>) -- a minimum opener with a big fit and 
      extra playing strength. If your hand has great high-card strength, start 
      with a cuebid if the auction gives you room.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Cuebid</b> (1C-2H-2S-Pass-<b>3H</b>) 
      -- forcing-to-game strength. The cuebid usually suggests a fit, but also 
      starts the description of other big hands (opener denies the fit if he 
      rebids notrump or his own suit later). You can use the cuebid to ask for a 
      stopper, start a slam-try sequence or just clarify that you have extra 
      high-card strength and defensive values. This information may be critical 
      in helping your partner make a decision if the opponents sacrifice.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Jump cuebid</b> (1D-1S-2H- 
      Pass-<b>3S</b>) -- a splinter, showing a singleton, great trump support 
      (4+ cards) and slam-try values.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If your RHO competes</b> 
      (by raising his partner's suit or bidding the fourth suit), it's helpful 
      to adjust your definitions for a few of opener's rebids:</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Competitive raise of 
      partner's suit</b> (1D-1S-2H-2S-<b>3H</b>) -- a minimum with a fit for 
      partner's suit. A raise in competition is <i><b>not</b></i> invitational 
      to game.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Double</b> (1D-1S-2H-. 2S-<b>DBL</b>) 
      -- You may choose to treat a double as penalty, but many partnerships 
      prefer to use it as &quot;positive&quot;, showing extra values but with no 
      clear-cut action. It tends to describe a hand with defensive strength, but 
      without length in partner's suit.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Over Responder's Negative Double</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If partner makes a negative double 
  instead of a Negative Freebid, be sure you alert the opponents to its two-way 
  nature with a &quot;Special Alert&quot;. If the opponents ask, tell them that 
  partner could have either a normal negative-double hand <i><b>or</b></i> a 
  forcing hand with one long suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In selecting your rebid, you 
  should assume for the time being that partner's negative double is 
  &quot;standard&quot; and make your natural rebid at the normal level. Keep in 
  mind, though, that partner may <i><b>not</b></i> have the 4-card major he's 
  temporarily showing, so use some caution. If you have a strong hand with 
  4-card support for partner's supposed major, try not to blast off to 4H or 
  4S-instead, start with a low-level cuebid to let partner clarify his hand 
  type.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You'll also want to think long and 
  hard about converting partner's negative double for penalties. Remember that 
  partner could have a monster one-suiter, so be careful about passing his 
  double unless your hand and the vulnerability screams that it's right.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Over Responder's Jump Shift</font></h3> 
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responder's jump-shift in 
  competition (1D-1S-<b>3C</b>) is invitational, showing a strong 6+-card suit 
  and a hand worth about 10-11 pts. Partner will often have a &quot;cover 
  card&quot; for you outside his suit, but in general, his jump will be based on 
  playing strength, not on high-card values. As opener, you have to evaluate 
  your chances for game based on that picture of partner's hand. Your 
  point-count isn't important; quick tricks, a trump fit and ruffing values are.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Try rebidding these hands as 
  opener after partner's NFB:</font>
