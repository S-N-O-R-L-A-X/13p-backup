    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Called &quot;a modern solution to
        a common bidding problem&quot; by the <i>Encyclopedia of Bridge</i>, the
        Negative Freebid has become a popular addition to many partnerships' systems.
        Whether you and your partner decide to use this bid or not, it's likely you'll
        be playing pairs who do, so it's a good idea to arm yourself with some
        information.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The Negative Freebid is not really
        a convention (all of responder's and opener's bids are natural) but is best
        classified as a bidding treatment or agreement. When using Negative Freebids,
        you and partner agree to lower the point requirements for some of responder's
        freebids in competitive auctions. This increases responder's ability to show a
        long suit after an opponent overcalls and improves your chances of finding a
        fit.</font>

        standard freebids</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Consider this typical situation.
        Partner opens 1D, your RHO overcalls 1S, and you hold:</font>

    </blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">With standard methods, a new-suit
        bid at the two-level would promise at least 11 points (perhaps a good 10).
        Neither of these hands is strong enough to bid your suit freely, so what do
        you do?</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>With Hand #1,</b> the usual
        solution is to make a negative double. Since partner will seldom be kind
        enough to bid hearts, you plan on bidding 2H over his expected rebid of 1NT,
        2C or 2D.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">But what if LHO raises his
        partner's spade suit? When the auction is passed back to you, you'll have
        another dilemma-pass and lose a possible partscore, or risk a 3H bid, which
        could be a disaster if partner doesn't have a suitable trump holding.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>With Hand #2,</b> the negative
        double isn't even an option. You're more or less &quot;stuck&quot; with
        passing and hoping you can show your hand later. If LHO raises his partner's
        spade overcall, you may be shut out forever.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Even if LHO passes and partner
        reopens with a double, you have no good way to describe this hand. A jump to
        3C would show some values, but virtually promises a 6-card suit. And 2C is
        somewhat of an underbid, since you have a considerably better suit and hand
        than partner might expect.</font>

      <font size="2">The Negative-Freebid Solution</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The Negative Freebid (NFB) allows
        you to make your natural response with hands like those above, but without
        promising game-invitational values or catapulting the auction too high.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">A NFB is used when an opponent
        overcalls your side's opening bid and responder has a long suit that cannot be
        shown at the one-level. In the examples above, you would make a NFB of 2H with
        Hand #1 and 2C with Hand #2.</font>

      <font size="2">Responder's Use of the Negative
        Freebid</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Responder's NFB is always a
        non-jump, new-suit bid between 2C and 3D. It is an alertable bid that shows:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">A good suit-a 6+-card suit or
            a strong 5-carder.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">5-11 points.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">If partner opened 1H or 1S, no
            3-card or longer support for partner's suit.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Some pairs prefer to play NFBs
        through 3S, but this can create some very awkward auctions when responder
        holds a strong hand. More often, you'll want to use the 3H and 3S bids to show
        forcing hands.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><i><b>Remember:</b></i> These
        freebids are called &quot;negative&quot; because they're non-forcing. They
        are, however, intended as constructive; they show good suits and good playing
        values.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Responder's new-suit bid is <i><b>NOT</b></i>
        a NFB if the bid is made:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">At a level of 3H or higher. If
            partner opens 1S and your RHO overcalls 3D, no Negative Freebid is
            available; your new-suit bid of 3H or 4C is forcing.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">At the one-level. Responder's
            new-suit bid at the one-level carries the standard meaning. After 1D by
            partner, 1H by RHO, a freebid of 1S is unlimited, showing 6+ points and a
            5+-card suit (since you would make a negative double if you held only 4
            spades).</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Much of your success with this
        system depends on your hand evaluation skills. Remember that a Negative
        Freebid tends to tell partner you have a one-suited hand without features that
        would be more valuable in other contracts. Your choice of whether or not to
        use the NFB, then, depends not just on your high-card values and suit quality,
        but on your outside holdings. The vulnerability and the form of scoring may
        also affect your decision (you'll usually want to be more conservative at IMPs).</font>

    <hr>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Negative Freebids (NFB's) are
        growing in popularity because they allow responder to make more natural,
        non-forcing bids, which improves your chances of finding a fit. Adding this to
        your system is simple enough-all you have to remember is that in competitive
        auctions, responder's new-suit bids between 2C and 3D are not forcing. They
        show 5-11 points and a long suit (6+-cards, or a very strong 5-carder).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Obviously, this agreement affects
        the way you'll bid your stronger hands, so you also need to adjust the
        meanings of some other bids. The two main changes involve negative doubles and
        responder's jump shifts in competition.</font>

    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Since responder's freebids through
        3D are not forcing, you need a way to show a long suit and forcing-to-game
        values. To do this, responder must use the negative double to start the
        description of all strong hands with long suits. After opener's response to
        the negative double, any new-suit bid by responder then shows a 5+-card suit
        and is forcing to game.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Adding Negative Freebids to your
        system does not change the way you bid your &quot;normal&quot; negative double
        hands. As responder, you still use the negative double to describe hands of
        limited high-card strength. The meaning of your negative double is changed <i><b>only</b></i>
        if you rebid a new suit later.</font>

        show extra strength and try for slam. 6C, 6D or even 6NT are likely contracts.</font>

      <font size="2"><b>With Hand #4,</b> you'll also

        game. Note that even though this hand's point-count falls into the 5-11 HCP
        range for a NFB, it has the playing strength of an opening bid. A diamond or
        heart slam is a strong possibility, so show your strength by starting with the
        negative double. Don't risk partner passing a NFB of 2H (or even a jump to 3H,
        which is described below).</font>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">So far, we've covered the ways
        responder can show a long suit with a relatively weak hand and with a forcing
        hand. With the Negative Freebid system, you can also show a third hand
        type-one that's at the top of the NFB point-range and has a very strong suit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">To show this highly invitational
        hand, responder jump-shifts after an opponent overcalls. The jump in a new
        suit shows:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">A strong 6+-card suit.</font>

        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Game-invitational values
            (10-11 playing pts.)</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">After partner opens 1D and RHO
        overcalls 1S, you would jump to 3H with <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">J3

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Opener is now well placed to
        evaluate chances for game. Since he knows you don't have great high-card
        strength outside your suit, he can pass with a &quot;soft&quot; 13 or 14
        points. With good quick tricks and/or a fit, he can bid game, even with a bare
        minimum opener.</font>

      <font size="2">Responder's Cuebids</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The negative double starts the
        description of strong hands that have length in an unbid suit. If you just
        want to show strength with support <i><b>for partner's suit</b></i>, there's
        no need to start with a negative double -- use a direct cuebid instead.</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>If partner opens a major</b>
            and an opponent overcalls, you can cuebid with virtually any distribution
            that includes support for opener's suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>If partner opens a minor</b>
            and an opponent overcalls, your cuebid denies 4+-card length in an unbid
            major. If you have a major suit, use the negative double first to check
            for a 4-4 fit. You can then cuebid to show support for partner's suit
            later.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Depending on your preferences,
        responder's immediate cuebid need not be forcing to game. The modern, and most
        effective, treatment is to use the direct cuebid to show <i><b>limit-raise
            values or better</b></i>. Your jump-raise in competition (1H by partner - 1S
        by RHO - <b>3H</b> by you), then, is preemptive. After responder's cuebid,
        opener must show <i><b>his</b></i> strength with his rebid. Opener retreats to
        3 of his suit to show a hand that wouldn't have accepted a limit raise; he
        makes any other bid to show a game acceptance.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">So what does the opening bidder do
        with all this information? In the final article in this series, we'll discuss
        the meanings of opener's rebids and ways he can evaluate his hand.</font>

    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Many players like Negative
        Freebids like because they make it easier for responder to show his long suit
        in competitive auctions. This helps you find trump fits that might otherwise
        be &quot;lost&quot; with standard methods, but it also requires you to use
        careful judgment later in the auction.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If you and your partner decide to
        use Negative Freebids (NFB's), you agree that in competitive auctions,
        responder's new-suit bids between 2C and 3D are not forcing. These alertable
        bids show long suits (6+-cards, or strong 5-carders) and limited high-card
        values (5-11 pts.).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">After you open and partner makes a
        NFB, you may have enough information to place the final contract. If not,
        you'll need to choose a rebid that describes your strength and fit for
        partner's suit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>If your RHO passes</b> your
        partner's NFB, the meanings of your rebids are:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Pass -- </b>a minimum with
            no interest in higher contracts. Passing does not promise a fit, so if you
            have a minimum with poor support, don't &quot;run&quot; to 2NT.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Rebid of your first suit</b>
            (1D-1S-2H-Pass-<b>3D</b>) -- not forcing, showing a minimum with a long,
            strong suit <i><b>and</b></i> no fit for partner's suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>2NT</b> (1D-1S-2H-Pass-<b>2NT</b>)
            -- Invitational high-card strength (16-18 pts.) with stoppers in the
            opponent's suit. This usually denies a good fit for partner's suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A free raise of partner's
              suit</b> (1D-1S-2H-Pass-<b>3H</b>) -- game invitational, showing a fitting
            hand worth about 15-18 playing points. Since partner has promised a strong
            suit, a fit may be a good doubleton or better.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Jump to game in partner's
              suit</b> (1D-1S-2H-Pass-<b>4H</b>) -- a minimum opener with a big fit and
            extra playing strength. If your hand has great high-card strength, start
            with a cuebid if the auction gives you room.</font>

          <font size="2"><b>Cuebid</b> (1C-2H-2S-Pass-<b>3H</b>)
            -- forcing-to-game strength. The cuebid usually suggests a fit, but also
            starts the description of other big hands (opener denies the fit if he
            rebids notrump or his own suit later). You can use the cuebid to ask for a
            stopper, start a slam-try sequence or just clarify that you have extra
            high-card strength and defensive values. This information may be critical
            in helping your partner make a decision if the opponents sacrifice.</font>

          <font size="2"><b>If your RHO competes</b>
            (by raising his partner's suit or bidding the fourth suit), it's helpful

      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Competitive raise of
              partner's suit</b> (1D-1S-2H-2S-<b>3H</b>) -- a minimum with a fit for
            partner's suit. A raise in competition is <i><b>not</b></i> invitational
            to game.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Double</b> (1D-1S-2H-. 2S-<b>DBL</b>)
            -- You may choose to treat a double as penalty, but many partnerships
            prefer to use it as &quot;positive&quot;, showing extra values but with no
            clear-cut action. It tends to describe a hand with defensive strength, but
            without length in partner's suit.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Over Responder's Negative Double</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If partner makes a negative double
        instead of a Negative Freebid, be sure you alert the opponents to its two-way
        nature with a &quot;Special Alert&quot;. If the opponents ask, tell them that
        partner could have either a normal negative-double hand <i><b>or</b></i> a
        forcing hand with one long suit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In selecting your rebid, you
        should assume for the time being that partner's negative double is
        &quot;standard&quot; and make your natural rebid at the normal level. Keep in
        mind, though, that partner may <i><b>not</b></i> have the 4-card major he's
        temporarily showing, so use some caution. If you have a strong hand with
        4-card support for partner's supposed major, try not to blast off to 4H or
        4S-instead, start with a low-level cuebid to let partner clarify his hand
        type.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">You'll also want to think long and
        hard about converting partner's negative double for penalties. Remember that
        partner could have a monster one-suiter, so be careful about passing his
        double unless your hand and the vulnerability screams that it's right.</font>

    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Responder's jump-shift in
        competition (1D-1S-<b>3C</b>) is invitational, showing a strong 6+-card suit
        and a hand worth about 10-11 pts. Partner will often have a &quot;cover
        card&quot; for you outside his suit, but in general, his jump will be based on
        playing strength, not on high-card values. As opener, you have to evaluate
        your chances for game based on that picture of partner's hand. Your
        point-count isn't important; quick tricks, a trump fit and ruffing values are.</font>
