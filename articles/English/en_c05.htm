  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Jump Reverse Rebids by Opener&nbsp;</font></h2>
  <hr width="100%">
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This convention solves the opening 
  bidder's problem of how to accurately describe a minimum 6-5 hand that has 
  greater length in the lower-ranking suit. For example, if you're opener with&nbsp; 
  <b>&nbsp; <img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">4&nbsp; <img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KQJ93&nbsp; 
  <img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ10765&nbsp; <img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">4</b> 
  you have a dilemma. If you open 1H, the best you can do is show 5-5 
  distribution by rebidding diamonds twice. If you instead open 1D, you can show 
  your 6-5 pattern by rebidding 2H and 3H, but that creates a reverse auction 
  that shows significantly more high-card strength.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The solution is to use the <b><i>jump</i></b> 
  in the higher-ranking suit as natural, limited and non-forcing. With the hand 
  above, you open 1D. Over partner's 1-level suit or notrump response, you rebid 
  3H to show a 6-5 hand with minimum high-card strength.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opener's Rebids</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The requirements for using a 
  jump-reverse are:<br>
  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1-</b>You're the opening bidder and have 6-5 
  distribution, with 6 cards in the lower-ranking suit.<br>
  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2-</b>You have the playing strength (but not the 
  high-card values) to play at the 3-level opposite a minimum response. This 
  means your suits should be strong -- ideally, most (or all) of your honor 
  cards will be in your long suits. For example, a jump-reverse is not 
  recommended with a hand like&nbsp; <img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>K&nbsp; 
  <img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A&nbsp; <img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">J6542&nbsp; 
  <img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ10643</b>. With this, just open 1C 
  and rebid 2C.<br>
  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3-</b>You have minimum high-card values (10-15 
  pts.) -- a hand that's worth an opening bid, but has less than full reversing 
  values (16-17 pts.).<br>
  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4-</b>Responder<b> </b>makes a 1-level bid that 
  bypasses your 5-card suit -- i.e. you must go to the 2-level to bid your 
  second suit. (You may also use the jump-reverse if an opponent's overcall has 
  forced you to the 2-level, whether or not partner has responded.)</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Jump-Reverse Auctions</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Typical jump-reverse auctions that 
  carry this meaning include:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1C-1H-3D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  1H-1NT-3S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1D-1S-3H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  1C-(1H)-1S-(P)-3D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  1C-(P)-P-(1S)-3H</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Note that you do <b><i>not</i></b> 
  use the jump if partner's response leaves you room to show your second suit at 
  the 1-level. If you open 1D with &nbsp; <img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>AK874&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  <img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">Void&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ10863&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  <img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K4</b>&nbsp; and partner responds 1H, 
  a jump to 2S should be a strong jump shift (19+ pts.). With the hand above, 
  you can show your pattern and minimum values by simply rebidding 1S and then 
  2S.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Note also that you do not promise 
  6-5 distribution if you jump after partner has made a negative double. After 
  the auction 1C by you -- (1S overcall) -- Double by partner, your jump to 3D 
  or 3H would be a simple value bid, promising at least 4-card support and 
  invitational strength.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Most pairs who play this 
  convention choose <b><i>not</i></b> to apply it if partner makes a 2/1 
  response, especially in a 2/1 forcing-to-game system. After 1D by you -- 2C by 
  partner, it's best to rebid only 2H with&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>A&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  <img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ976&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">A109864&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  <img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">4</b>. This saves space and allows you 
  to use a jump to 3H here as a splinter (good club support, singleton heart, 
  big hand).</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responder's Rebids</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opener's jump-reverse is not 
  forcing. Responder can pass or take a signoff preference back to opener's 
  first suit if he has no interest in game. In general, it's assumed that opener 
  has given a complete description of his hand, so it's up to responder to place 
  the contract.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responder should evaluate his 
  holdings in opener's suits and stretch to bid game if he has fitting cards. 
  Based on the Losing Trick Count, opener will usually have a hand with 4 
  (possibly 5) losers. Responder should bid a major-suit game if he has a fit <b><i>and</i></b> 
  can cover 1.5-2 of opener's losers. He should bid a minor-suit game if he has 
  a fit and can cover 2.5-3 of opener's losers.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After the auction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <b>?</b><br>
  the meanings of responder's rebids are:</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1-Pass</font></b><font size="2"> 
  = a weak, possibly non-fitting hand that prefers opener's second suit -- 
  &nbsp; <img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>KQ1032&nbsp; <img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">763&nbsp; 
  <img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ8&nbsp; <img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">54. 
  </b>Partner will most often be 1-1 in the outside suits, so you can't count 
  your kings as covering any of his losers.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2-Preference to opener's first suit (<i>4C</i>)</b> 
  = a weak, possibly non-fitting hand that prefers opener's 6-card suit. This is 
  a signoff, and opener should pass.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>3-Game bid in either of opener's suits (<i>4H </i>or<i> 
  5C</i>)</b> = to play. Opener should always pass.&nbsp; In the auction above, 
  if you hold&nbsp; <img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>A9854&nbsp; <img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">1043&nbsp; 
  <img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">432&nbsp; <img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K9 
  </b>, you have at least two of partner's losers covered (a club and a spade, 
  plus a possible club ruff), so you should bid 4H. Similarly, with&nbsp; <img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>A9854&nbsp; 
  <img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">10&nbsp; <img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">9432&nbsp; 
  <img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K97</b> , you have at least 3 losers 
  covered (a spade, a club and 1-2 heart ruffs), so bid 5C.<br>
  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4-Rebid of your suit (<i>3S or 4S</i>)</b> = to 
  play, showing great length in your suit and probably no fit for opener's 
  suits.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>5-3NT </b>= to play.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>6-4NT</b> = key-card Blackwood for opener's <b><i>second</i></b> 
  suit.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>7-Fourth suit (<i>4D</i>)</b> = a slam-try in 
  opener's <b><i>first</i></b> suit. Opener should cuebid a below-game 
  first-round control (4H or 4S) if he has one, or he can use key-card Blackwood 
  if he wants to immediately accept the slam try. Any subsequent Blackwood bid 
  by opener or responder is key-card for opener's first suit.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, if opener has a first-round control in 
  the fourth suit <b><i>and</i></b> a cuebid of that suit would be past game (as 
  5D would be in the auction above), you can agree to use opener's 4NT rebid as 
  a cuebid of the fourth suit. After 1C-1S-3H-4D, opener's 4NT would show an ace 
  or void in diamonds, but no first-round control of hearts or spades.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet another variation is to use responder's 
  fourth-suit bid as key-card Blackwood for opener's second suit. Partnerships 
  should discuss these auctions and decide which treatment they prefer.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>8-Below-game raise of opener's second suit </b>(1C-1S-3D-<b><i>4D</i></b>) 
  = invitational to game, showing a fit and a hand that can cover 2 losers.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Summary</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This convention can be a very 
  valuable addition to almost any Standard American-based system. It's 
  especially effective in finding short-point games and slams, and can have 
  preemptive value. Using the jump-reverse as non-forcing does not require you 
  to give up any other meanings, as the jump is an otherwise idle bid. If opener 
  has a very strong high-card hand, there's no need to jump -- he can still show 
  his 6-5 distribution by making a forcing 2-level reverse and then rebidding 
  his second suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The main disadvantage is that 
  although the jump rebid gives a close-to-perfect description of opener's hand, 
  it takes the auction very high, very fast. If responder has a weak, 
  non-fitting hand with shortness in opener's second suit, the auction will be 
  propelled to the 4-level when he's forced to take a preference back to the 
  first suit. To make best use of this convention (and avoid disasters), opener 
  and responder must have advanced hand-evaluation skills and exercise good 
  judgment.<br>
