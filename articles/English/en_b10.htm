  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Jacoby 2NT -- Forcing Major-Suit 
  Raise</font></h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Playing a Standard American 
  bidding system, you have three direct ways to show trump support after partner 
  opens 1H or 1S:</font>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A simple raise to two (1S-<strong>2S</strong>), 
      to show 6-9 pts.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A jump to three (1S-<strong>3S</strong>), 
      which can be played either of two ways, depending on your preference: as a 
      <i><b>forcing raise</b></i> (12+ pts.), or as an invitational <i><b>limit 
      raise</b></i> (10-11 pts.).</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A jump to game (1S-<strong>4S</strong>), 
      to show limited high-card points (usually about 7-10), but great trump 
      length and playing strength.</font></li>
  </ol>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you play the more modern system 
  of using the jump to 3 as a limit raise, you have a somewhat awkward problem 
  when you hold a forcing-to-game hand with trump support. One solution is to 
  bid a new suit first, temporarily &quot;concealing&quot; your support, then 
  jump to game in partner's suit at your next turn (an auction like 1S by 
  partner - 2C by you - 2NT - 4S).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">There are a number of different 
  conventions designed to help you describe these strong hands. One of the most 
  popular is the Jacoby 2NT, which was invented by Oswald Jacoby (who also 
  invented Jacoby Transfers). To use this convention, your partnership agrees 
  that after you open 1H or 1S and your partner is an <strong><i>unpassed hand</i></strong>, 
  his jump to 2NT shows:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Forcing-to-game strength (12+ 
      points)</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Good trump support (4 or more 
      cards)</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The 2NT response forces you to at 
  least game level. It is not a suggestion to play in notrump; it shows support 
  and asks the 1H or 1S opener to further describe his hand.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Note that the Jacoby 2NT 
  convention is &quot;on&quot; only if responder has not previously passed in 
  the auction. If you are a passed hand, your jump to 2NT is natural, showing a 
  balanced hand of 11-12 points.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opener's rebids</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In addition to giving responder a 
  direct way to show a forcing hand, the Jacoby 2NT improves the accuracy of 
  your slam bidding. Its biggest advantage is that it gives opener room to 
  further describe his hand. There are a number of different meanings you can 
  assign to opener's rebids. Here's one of the most commonly used structures:</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="2">If you open 1 of a major 
  and partner responds 2NT:</font></strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your first obligation is to 
      bid 3 of a suit where you have a singleton or void.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you have a another 
      semi-strong 5-card suit, show it by jumping to 4 of the suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you have extra values (but 
      no singleton or void), describe your strength and pattern by rebidding 3NT 
      with a fairly balanced hand <strong>or </strong>3 of your suit with extra 
      length (a 6+-card suit).</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you have a bare-minimum 
      opener with no singleton or void, jump to 4 of your suit. This is your 
      weakest rebid. It shows a fairly balanced hand with no interest in slam.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">For example, after you open 1S and 
  partner responds 2NT, the meanings of your rebids are:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>3C, 3D or 3H</b> = 
      Singleton or void in that suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>3S</b> = 14+ pts. with 
      extra length in your suit (or 19+ pts. if you're balanced), no singleton.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>3NT</b> = 15-18 pts., 
      balanced, no singleton.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>4C, 4D, 4H</b> = Good 
      5-card suit (QJxxx or better).</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>4S</b> = Minimum hand 
      (12-14 pts.), no singleton.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Once responder has this 
  information, he can decide how to proceed. If he's not interested in a slam, 
  he can just jump to game. If he wants to explore further, he can cuebid a new 
  suit to show an ace. This requests opener to cuebid an ace.</font>

       3D           4NT 
       5H           6S
</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After responder uses the Jacoby 
  2NT, opener bids 3D to show his singleton. This is encouraging news for 
  responder because it means his club and heart honors will fit well in 
  partner's hand. Knowing that his xxx suit is covered by opener's singleton -- 
  and that opener's outside strength is in clubs and/or hearts -- responder can 
  use Blackwood to check on aces, and then bid his 24-point slam.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Note that responder would evaluate 
  his hand very differently if opener's answer to the Jacoby 2NT had been 3C or 
  3H. Singletons in these suits wouldn't be helpful because responder's kings 
  may well be &quot;wasted&quot; cards opposite the singleton. Over opener's 3C 
  rebid, responder would just jump to 4S to show that he no longer had interest 
  in slam.</font>

        4H            6S
</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opener's 3S rebid denies a 
  singleton, but promises a good (somewhat distributional) opener. Responder 
  shows slam interest by cuebidding his club ace and opener cooperates by 
  cuebidding 4H. This shows the heart ace and <i><b>denies</b></i> the diamond 
  ace (since he'll cuebid his <i><b>cheapest</b></i> ace). Responder now knows 
  that the partnership has extra values, control of every suit and exactly three 
  aces. Since he doesn't need to use Blackwood, he jumps to 6S.<br>
