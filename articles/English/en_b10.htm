      <font size="4">Jacoby 2NT -- Forcing Major-Suit
        Raise</font>
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Playing a Standard American
        bidding system, you have three direct ways to show trump support after partner
        opens 1H or 1S:</font>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">A simple raise to two (1S-<strong>2S</strong>),
            to show 6-9 pts.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">A jump to three (1S-<strong>3S</strong>),
            which can be played either of two ways, depending on your preference: as a
            <i><b>forcing raise</b></i> (12+ pts.), or as an invitational <i><b>limit
                raise</b></i> (10-11 pts.).
          </font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">A jump to game (1S-<strong>4S</strong>),
            to show limited high-card points (usually about 7-10), but great trump
            length and playing strength.</font>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If you play the more modern system
        of using the jump to 3 as a limit raise, you have a somewhat awkward problem
        when you hold a forcing-to-game hand with trump support. One solution is to
        bid a new suit first, temporarily &quot;concealing&quot; your support, then
        jump to game in partner's suit at your next turn (an auction like 1S by
        partner - 2C by you - 2NT - 4S).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">There are a number of different
        conventions designed to help you describe these strong hands. One of the most
        popular is the Jacoby 2NT, which was invented by Oswald Jacoby (who also
        invented Jacoby Transfers). To use this convention, your partnership agrees
        that after you open 1H or 1S and your partner is an <strong><i>unpassed hand</i></strong>,
        his jump to 2NT shows:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Forcing-to-game strength (12+
            points)</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Good trump support (4 or more
            cards)</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The 2NT response forces you to at
        least game level. It is not a suggestion to play in notrump; it shows support
        and asks the 1H or 1S opener to further describe his hand.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Note that the Jacoby 2NT
        convention is &quot;on&quot; only if responder has not previously passed in
        the auction. If you are a passed hand, your jump to 2NT is natural, showing a
        balanced hand of 11-12 points.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">　
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Opener's rebids</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In addition to giving responder a
        direct way to show a forcing hand, the Jacoby 2NT improves the accuracy of
        your slam bidding. Its biggest advantage is that it gives opener room to
        further describe his hand. There are a number of different meanings you can
        assign to opener's rebids. Here's one of the most commonly used structures:</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><strong>
        <font size="2">If you open 1 of a major
          and partner responds 2NT:</font>
      </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Your first obligation is to
            bid 3 of a suit where you have a singleton or void.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">If you have a another
            semi-strong 5-card suit, show it by jumping to 4 of the suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">If you have extra values (but
            no singleton or void), describe your strength and pattern by rebidding 3NT
            with a fairly balanced hand <strong>or </strong>3 of your suit with extra
            length (a 6+-card suit).</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">If you have a bare-minimum
            opener with no singleton or void, jump to 4 of your suit. This is your
            weakest rebid. It shows a fairly balanced hand with no interest in slam.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">For example, after you open 1S and
        partner responds 2NT, the meanings of your rebids are:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>3C, 3D or 3H</b> =
            Singleton or void in that suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>3S</b> = 14+ pts. with
            extra length in your suit (or 19+ pts. if you're balanced), no singleton.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>3NT</b> = 15-18 pts.,
            balanced, no singleton.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>4C, 4D, 4H</b> = Good
            5-card suit (QJxxx or better).</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>4S</b> = Minimum hand
            (12-14 pts.), no singleton.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Once responder has this
        information, he can decide how to proceed. If he's not interested in a slam,
        he can just jump to game. If he wants to explore further, he can cuebid a new
        suit to show an ace. This requests opener to cuebid an ace.</font>

</font></pre>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">After responder uses the Jacoby
        2NT, opener bids 3D to show his singleton. This is encouraging news for
        responder because it means his club and heart honors will fit well in
        partner's hand. Knowing that his xxx suit is covered by opener's singleton --
        and that opener's outside strength is in clubs and/or hearts -- responder can
        use Blackwood to check on aces, and then bid his 24-point slam.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Note that responder would evaluate
        his hand very differently if opener's answer to the Jacoby 2NT had been 3C or
        3H. Singletons in these suits wouldn't be helpful because responder's kings
        may well be &quot;wasted&quot; cards opposite the singleton. Over opener's 3C
        rebid, responder would just jump to 4S to show that he no longer had interest
        in slam.</font>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Opener's 3S rebid denies a
        singleton, but promises a good (somewhat distributional) opener. Responder
        shows slam interest by cuebidding his club ace and opener cooperates by
        cuebidding 4H. This shows the heart ace and <i><b>denies</b></i> the diamond
        ace (since he'll cuebid his <i><b>cheapest</b></i> ace). Responder now knows
        that the partnership has extra values, control of every suit and exactly three
        aces. Since he doesn't need to use Blackwood, he jumps to 6S.<br>
