          Overcalls</font>

    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Part 1-- Unusual vs. Unusual</font>
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">One of your toughest competitive
        bidding problems comes when the opponents make a two-suited overcall. Unusual
        2NT overcalls and Michaels cuebids can work like preempts because they use up
        bidding space you may need to find your contract. They can also cause problems
        because there's no &quot;Standard American&quot; way for responder to show
        many types of hands.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The old-fashioned approach to
        dealing with these overcalls was to use cuebids of the opponent's suits to
        show stoppers or controls. After 1H by partner, 2NT by RHO (clubs and
        diamonds), your 3D cuebid would show a diamond stopper and ask partner to bid
        3NT with a club stopper.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Much more valuable, though, are
        systems that describe your holdings in suits the overcaller <b><i>doesn't</i></b>
        have. Today, many partnerships play the Unusual vs. Unusual convention, which
        uses the cuebids to show length in your two potential trump suits. The name
        refers to the &quot;unusual&quot; meaning of responder's cuebids after an
        opponent's unusual 2NT overcall, but the treatment can be used over some
        Michaels cuebids, too.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Actually, this convention isn't so
        unusual. You'll see it listed in the lower right-hand corner of many pairs'
        convention cards, and you may even have it on yours. But because there are
        different ways to play Unusual vs. Unusual, just adding it to your card
        doesn't constitute a clear agreement. You and your partner need to discuss
        which form of the convention you'll use and agree on the exact meanings of
        responder's bids.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">One form of Unusual vs. Unusual
        uses the lower-ranking cuebid to promise support for partner's suit and the
        higher-ranking cuebid to show length in the unbid suit. A slightly different
        treatment -- and the one that's probably most popular among expert players --
        follows the same principle, but ties the cuebids to the rank of the suits.
        This easy-to-remember system, often called &quot;Lower-Lower&quot;, works like
        this:</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">&quot;Lower-Lower&quot; responses
        over the opponents' Unusual 2NT</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">When an opponent overcalls 2NT,
        you assume that the two suits he showed are &quot;theirs&quot; and the other
        two suits (the suit partner opened and the unbid suit) are &quot;yours&quot;.
        As responder, you have two cuebids available in their suits to describe your
        length in your suits. The meanings of your cuebids are:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Cuebid of the overcaller's
              LOWER-ranking suit </b>(1H-2NT-<b>3C</b>) = Length in <b><i>our</i></b>
            lower-ranking suit. In this auction, the 3C cuebid would show heart
            support and at least invitational strength.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Cuebid of the overcaller's
              HIGHER-ranking suit </b>(1H-2NT-<b>3D</b>) = Length in <b><i>our</i></b>
            higher-ranking suit. In this auction, the higher-ranking suit is the
            &quot;unbid&quot; suit, so your cuebid shows 5+ spades and game values.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Using this system, if partner
        opens a major and the opponent overcalls 2NT, your 3C cuebid always shows
        hearts; a 3D cuebid always shows spades.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The length and strength you need
        for these cuebids depend on whether you're raising partner or showing the
        unbid suit. The cuebid in support of partner's suit (1H-2NT-<b>3C</b> or
        1S-2NT-<b>3D</b>) shows limit-raise or better strength and enough length to
        make his suit trumps (3+-cards). The cuebid for the unbid suit (1H-2NT-<b>3D</b>
        or 1S-2NT-<b>3C</b>) promises game-forcing strength and enough length to
        suggest that suit as trumps (5+ cards).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Cuebids operate the same way when
        partner opens a minor. After 1C by partner, 2NT by LHO (diamonds and hearts),
        your bid of 3D (the lower cuebid) shows club support; 3H (the higher cuebid)
        shows spades.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The only variation occurs when
        partner opens a minor and the opponent's 2NT overcall shows both minors. In
        this rare case, use 3C and 3D as cuebids to describe 4+-card length in the
        majors. After 1D by partner, 2NT on your right (clubs and diamonds), your 3C
        cuebid shows hearts, 3D shows spades. (Since the opponent has 5 diamonds, you
        won't want to use 3D as a natural raise.)</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Other responses</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Because these cuebids handle
        several types of hands, they allow you to better define your other bids. After
        an opening bid by partner and a 2NT overcall, the meanings of your other
        responses are:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Double</b> = 9-10+ pts.

          <font size="2"><b>Simple raise of partner's
              suit </b>(1S-2NT-<b>3S</b>) = Trump support and about 7-10 playing pts.</font>

          <font size="2"><b>Raise to game in partner's
              suit </b>(1S-2NT-<b>4S</b>) = Long trumps and good playing strength, with

          <font size="2"><b>Freebid of the fourth suit </b>(1S-2NT-<b>3H</b>)

    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The Unusual vs. Unusual convention
        is popular because it offers an accurate, flexible way for responder to
        describe his hand after an unusual 2NT overcall by an opponent. Although that
        use is the origin of the convention's name, Unusual vs. Unusual can also be
        valuable over other two-suited overcalls. These include Michaels cuebids over
        minor openings, top-and-bottom cuebids and other overcalls that show two
        specific suits.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">&quot;Lower-Lower&quot; cuebids
        over Michaels overcalls that identify both suits</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In the most popular form of
        Unusual vs. Unusual, often called &quot;Lower-Lower&quot;, responder cuebids
        the overcaller's lower-ranking suit to show length or support in the
        lower-ranking of the other two suits; the higher-ranking cuebid shows the
        higher-ranking suit. If partner opens a major and the opponent bids 2NT, a 3C
        cuebid shows heart length or support; 3D shows spades. (See the [ MONTH ] <i>Bulletin</i>
        for details on using this convention over 2NT overcalls.)</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The same approach can be used when
        an opponent makes a Michaels cuebid showing two known suits. If the overcall
        shows both majors (1C-2C or 1D-2D), responder's cuebids describe his length in
        the minors. The meanings of the cuebids are:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Cuebid of the opponent's
              LOWER-ranking suit </b>(1C-2C-<b>2H</b>) = Length in <b><i>our</i></b>
            lower-ranking suit. In this auction, the 2H cuebid would show club support
            and at least invitational strength.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Cuebid of the opponent's
              HIGHER-ranking suit </b>(1C-2C-<b>2S</b>) = Length in <b><i>our</i></b>
            higher-ranking suit. In this auction, the higher-ranking suit is the unbid
            suit, so your cuebid shows 5+ diamonds and game values.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">As with cuebids over an Unusual
        2NT, the length and strength you promise depend on whether you're raising
        partner or showing the unbid suit. The cuebid in support of partner's suit
        (1C-2C-<b>2H</b> or 1D-2D-<b>2S</b>) shows 4+-card length and limit-raise or
        better strength. The cuebid for the unbid suit (1C-2C-<b>2S</b> or 1D-2D-<b>2H</b>)
        promises a game-forcing hand and a 5+-card suit.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">&quot;Lower-Lower&quot; cuebids
        over other overcalls showing two known suits</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The &quot;Lower-Lower&quot;
        approach can be used effectively against any overcall that specifies two
        suits. Against most of these overcalls, the cheaper available cuebid will be
        in the opponent's lower-ranking suit. For the rare cases when it isn't, always
        use the <b>cheaper</b> cuebid to show length or support in your lower-ranking
        suit, even if that cuebid is in the opponent's higher-ranking suit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">About the only time you'll face
        this situation is when partner opens 1D or 1H and the opponent makes a
        top-and-bottom cuebid showing spades and clubs. To save bidding room, use the
        cheaper cuebid (2S) to show length or support in diamonds, your lower-ranking
        suit; use the higher cuebid (3C) to describe the hand with a heart suit.</font>

      <font size="2">Part 3 -- Vs. Michaels Cuebids
        over Majors (1H-2H, 1S-2S)</font>
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In the last two articles, we
        discussed the use of Unusual vs. Unusual cuebids over an opponent's unusual
        2NT or Michaels overcall that shows two known suits. But what if the opponent
        makes a two-suited overcall that identifies only one suit?</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If partner opens a major, the
        opponent's Michaels cuebid shows the other major but doesn't specify which
        minor he has. In this case, only one cuebid is available and should be used to
        show invitational or better support for partner's major.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Since Unusual vs. Unusual cuebids
        work only if both suits are known, you have to find another way to describe
        good hands without trump support. Artificial systems have been developed to
        handle this problem, but most partnerships find they can get by with a
        simplified method. Over &quot;ambiguous&quot; Michaels (1H-2H or 1S-2S),
        you'll be able to describe most responding hands by following these bidding
        guidelines:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A cuebid of the
              overcaller's known suit</b> always shows limit-raise or better support for
            partner's major. Opener's rebid will tell you if he would have accepted a
            limit raise.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A</b> <b>jump cuebid </b>(or
            a jump to 4C or 4D) shows a singleton and a slam try in partner's suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A double or notrump
              response </b>is used to describe all non-supporting hands of 10+ pts.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>All other bids</b> --
            raises of partner's suit and freebids of new suits -- are non-forcing.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The trickiest auctions are those
        where you have forcing-to-game strength without a fit for partner's major and
        without sure stoppers in all unbid suits. In these cases, your most likely
        game is usually 3NT, but with one of the overcaller's suits unknown, your
        search for stoppers can't always be an exact science.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The best strategy with these hands
        is to start with a double and let the opponents tell you where they have their
        best fit. If LHO prefers partner's major, he'll usually bid it directly; if
        not, he'll pass or bid 2NT to ask for partner's minor. With this information,
        you can then choose a rebid to further describe your hand.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Partner's action will also give
        you some clues. With most semi-balanced hands, he'll pass your first double
        and let you make the decision. But if he has a hand unsuitable for defense --
        a near-solid 6+-card trump suit or a strong two-suiter, for example -- he may
        show it before the auction gets back to you. Or, with a good trump holding in
        the suit your LHO bids, partner can make a penalty double. Assuming partner
        passes, the meanings of your rebids after an initial double are:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Double</b> = Penalty. If
            opener passed over your first double, he should usually pass again.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Pass </b>(over RHO's suit
            rebid) = Forcing, usually suggesting a tolerance for defending if partner
            has a good enough trump holding to double.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>New</b> <b>suit</b> =
            5+-card suit, forcing to game.</font>

        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>3NT</b> = Game strength

            necessarily guarantee a stopper in overcaller's second suit.</font>

        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Delayed cuebid</b> <b>of</b>

      <font size="2">Using your judgment</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">With these agreements, you'll be
        able to handle most bidding problems over a two-suited overcall. The most
        important element in your success, however, will be your good bidding
        judgment. When deciding whether to declare or defend after an opponent makes a
        two-suited overcall -- whether it identifies one or two known suits -- keep
        these guidelines in mind:</font>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">The overcall has warned you
            that wild distributions are likely, so don't be too optimistic. Close
            games, especially those where you have only an 8-card trump fit, may be
            doomed by bad breaks.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">The best time to compete for
            the contract is when you have a fit for partner's major. <b>The main
              factor in your evaluation should be your trump length, not your high-card
              points.</b> Stretch to compete if you have 4-card or longer support. Stay
            on the conservative side if you have only 3-card support.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">If you're considering a cuebid
            or double as your first response, try to plan your rebid in advance. Think
            about how the auction might progress and what bids will be available for
            you to further describe your hand.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">If you have scattered values
            without a fit for partner, give full consideration to defending. Even with
            a modest trump holding, you may collect a big penalty if you also have
            strength in the overcaller's second suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Pay attention to the
            vulnerability. If the opponents are vulnerable and you're not, think long
            and hard before you let them off the hook. Even at equal vulnerability, if
            you aren't certain about making your game, doubling and taking the
            &quot;sure&quot; plus score may be a good insurance policy.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">If you double the opponent's
            contract, lead a trump (or expect partner to lead one).</font>

            to play anything but 3NT -- you may improve your chances by getting to it
            quickly. You could conduct a more accurate search by doubling first, then
            asking for a stopper if the opponents bid diamonds. But think about how
            awkward your auction will be if partner can't show you one. You'll be
            forced to scramble to 4C, 5C or 4H in a weak 5-2 fit. I wouldn't expect a
            good score for any of these contracts.</font>

      <font size="2">The jump to 3NT with Hand #6
        breaks even when partner has a full diamond stopper. You can come out ahead
        when he has only a partial stopper, when the suit blocks, or, most important,
        when LHO doesn't lead diamonds. Remember that you know what RHO's second suit
        is, but his partner doesn't, and your auction hasn't given him the chance to
        find out. Even if a diamond lead sets the contract, LHO (who probably has
        fairly equal length in the minors) will have to guess to lead one.<br>
