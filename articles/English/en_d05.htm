  <b>What's your plan for the bidding?</b></font>
  <p><font size="2">This hand was dealt in the Life Master Pairs at the 1997 
  ACBL summer championships in Albuquerque NM, and it generated some lively 
  discussions after the game. Some players responded 2D, planning to continue 
  bidding diamonds until partner got the message. Others, many of whom were 
  playing a system where a 2-over-1 response is forcing to game, chose a Forcing 
  1NT to limit their high-card strength. This conventional response forces 
  opener to bid one more time so you can continue describing your hand.</font>
  <p><font size="2">Whether you choose 1NT or 2D, the real problem comes at your 
  second turn after partner jumps to 3S. What now?</font>
  <p><font size="2">Even though this was an &quot;expert&quot; event, the 
  players varied widely in their approaches with this hand, and the final scores 
  were all over the map. The most frequent choice was a raise to 4S, which is 
  the contract that would probably score the most matchpoints if it makes. These 
  players figured that their spade queen was a valuable filler, and they hoped 
  their diamond suit would be a source of tricks. Even the two 10's might be 
  helpful &quot;pushers&quot; if partner needed to develop tricks in hearts or 
  clubs.</font>
  <p><font size="2">The second most popular choice was a pessimistic pass. 
  Partner's 3S bid is highly invitational, but the passers didn't like having a 
  singleton (even a good one) for support, and they were discouraged by their 
  lack of aces and kings.</font>
  <p><font size="2">When I held this hand, the lack of an outside trick slowed 
  me down, too. I chose the Forcing 1NT to limit my hand, with the intention of 
  jumping in diamonds after partner's rebid. When partner jumped to 3S, I found 
  myself tempted by the high-scoring 4S contract, but finally decided that my 
  hand rated to be worthless in any contract but diamonds.</font>
  <p><font size="2">I couldn't bid 4D because we play any new-suit bid here as a 
  cuebid for a possible spade slam -- showing the ace of diamonds and a good 
  hand (10+ points) with some spade support. So I launched off to 5D, and that 
  ended the auction.</font>
  <h3><font size="2">The results</font></h3>
  <font size="2">Partner held just what he advertised --&nbsp;<img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>AKJ1086&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A85&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">3&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K84</b>. 
  The ace of clubs was onside, and I pitched my heart loser on one of dummy's 
  spades to end up with 11 tricks -- 7 diamonds, 2 spades, a club and a heart. 
  That was good for 80 percent of the matchpoints, which indicates how few pairs 
  were willing to bid 5D with this hand. Some pairs stopped in 4D, and they got 
  the second-highest score.</font>
  <p><font size="2">As you can see, the spade contracts were disasters, and most 
  declarers took only seven or eight tricks. The lead was a singleton diamond to 
  the ace, usually followed by a shift to hearts. If declarer tried to cash a 
  high diamond when he was in dummy with the spade queen, he went down 3 -- the 
  diamond was ruffed, the opponents led more hearts, and with no more dummy 
  entries, partner couldn't even lead up to his club king.</font>
  <p><font size="2">Optimism is often rewarded at matchpoints. If partner had 
  held Ax of diamonds and the same spade suit, the spade bidders would have 
  beaten my score. Counting on partner for a diamond fit, though, seemed way too 
  optimistic to me.&nbsp; When you hold an 8-card suit, the odds are heavy that 
  partner is very short, especially when you know he has a long suit of his own.</font>
  <h3><font size="2">Good bridge advice</font></h3>
  <font size="2">The lesson on this hand was summed by my friend <b>Lee Magee </b>of 
  Kansas City. When we were discussing this hand over New Mexican margaritas 
  after the session, one of our group asked Lee why he had been so confident 
  about his 5D bid. &quot;I have a hard-and-fast rule,&quot; Lee bellowed. 
  &quot;Never put down an 8-card suit in dummy!&quot;</font>
  <p><font size="2">That may be somewhat of an over-simplification, but it makes 
  good sense. When you have an auction in which you and partner have both shown 
  long suits, and you're in doubt about which one should be trumps, make the 
  weaker hand the declarer. Since the weak hand will have fewer outside entries, 
  its long suit may score tricks only if it's trumps -- especially if the suit 
  is &quot;topless&quot; (missing the ace and/or king), like the one in this 
  hand.<br>
