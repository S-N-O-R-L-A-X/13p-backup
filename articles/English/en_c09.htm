  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In previous articles, we looked at 
  &quot;standard&quot; default agreements you could use to determine if an 
  ambiguous double is penalty or takeout. It's important to remember that these 
  guidelines are used only for situations that aren't covered by your other 
  agreements or conventions. Your default agreements are valuable only if you 
  and partner know the exact conditions where the default <i><strong>doesn't</strong></i> 
  apply because a convention does.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The source of many disasters is 
  unclear agreements about responsive and maximal doubles. These problems often 
  occur, even in established partnerships, because we assume that conventions 
  are self-defining -- that once we agree to play a conventional double, both of 
  us will know how it's &quot;supposed&quot; to be played.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The solution, of course, is to 
  have a detailed discussion about the exact conditions where each double will 
  be used. There's seldom time for that when you're filling out a card with a 
  new partner, so it's helpful to know the &quot;modern standard&quot; 
  treatments. Here are some widely used guidelines to help you decide when your 
  conventions apply, and when you should rely on your default agreements.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responsive doubles</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Most pairs who play this popular 
  convention limit its use to these precise conditions:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>1 -</strong> Our first 
    action was a three-suit takeout double OR a simple suit overcall.<br>
    <strong>2 -</strong> It's possible we have a playable fit in any of <i><strong>three</strong></i> 
    suits.<br>
    <strong>3 -</strong> The opponents must have bid <i><strong>and</strong></i> 
    raised a suit.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you play this &quot;expert 
  standard&quot; treatment, responsive doubles are &quot;off&quot; -- and your 
  default agreements are &quot;on&quot; -- if partner has already narrowed down 
  the choice to two suits (with a Michaels cuebid, Unusual Notrump or a 
  two-suited takeout double). The same applies if he's shown a purely one-suited 
  hand (with a preempt) or if he's opened or overcalled notrump.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Since a responsive double always 
  suggests a possible interest in three suits, it isn't used if the opponents 
  have bid more than one suit, or if you've already bid and raised a suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The most important requirement -- 
  and the one violated most frequently -- is #3. If you play responsive doubles, 
  you may have something like &quot;Thru 3S ORO&quot; on your convention card. 
  The ORO stands for &quot;over raise only&quot;, which means <i><strong>both</strong></i> 
  opponents must have bid the same suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Even with these agreements in 
  place, some players can't resist the urge to invent other imaginative uses. 
  The problem comes when you make them up at the table. After a hand years ago, 
  a partner told me that he had meant his double as &quot;responsive-ish&quot;. 
  He had decided that a subtle (and undiscussed) takeout was the perfect way to 
  describe his specific hand, so he doubled, with the fond hope that I would 
  work it out. I didn't, and we were -670.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You'd be setting yourself up for 
  the same type of disaster if you doubled with the hand at the beginning of 
  this article. As much as you'd like to show the unbid suits here, you can't 
  use a responsive double if you follow the guidelines above. Opener has merely 
  rebid his suit without a raise, so your double would be penalty.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">So what can you bid with this 
  hand? Since the auction suggests a misfit, your best choice is probably a 
  pass. If you can't bear silence, the only alternative is to rub your rabbit's 
  foot and bid 3C.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can, of course, extend the use 
  of responsive doubles to auctions where an opponent rebids a suit. That 
  requires prior discussion, and, although it would be handy in this specific 
  problem, it's probably not the most valuable agreement in the long run. When 
  the opponents haven't confirmed a fit, you'll usually find it more beneficial 
  to use a double as penalty.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Maximal (Game-Try) Doubles</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This convention provides an 
  exception to the standard default &quot;It's a penalty double if we've already 
  found our fit.&quot; It's a popular way to solve the problem of how to show 
  extra values when the opponents take away your 3-level game try.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Also called game-try doubles, this 
  special double is used when:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>1 -</strong> The 
    doubler's partner has made a single raise of the doubler's suit.<br>
    <strong>2 -</strong> The doubler has not previously denied invitational 
    values.<br>
    <strong>3 -</strong> The opponents have competed to the 3-level in the suit <i><strong>directly</strong></i> 
    <i><strong>below</strong></i> ours.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here are some auctions that cause 
  problems for many pairs:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">    <u> Partner   RHO    You   LHO </u>
(A)   1H       2C     2H     3C 
      DBL   

(B)   1C      Pass    1S     2H 
      2S      3H      DBL     

(C)   1S      2H      2S    Pass 
      Pass    3H      DBL  

(D)   --      1D      1H    Pass 
      2H      3D      DBL    

Maximal doubles don't apply in (A) because partner had room to make a game try below 3 of your suit. His bid in the available side suit (diamonds) would be a general game try. However, if the opponents had been bidding diamonds (the &quot;maximum&quot; suit below yours), partner could double to invite game or bid 3H to sign off.</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Maximal doubles can also be used 
  by responder, as in (B). This isn't the &quot;classic&quot; use, so you would 
  want to discuss it with partner and develop a firm agreement.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (C), you've already limited 
  your hand, so your standard default makes this a penalty double. Some pairs 
  do, however, agree to play this double as &quot;cooperative&quot;, showing a 
  hand with two-way values. We'll discuss these special doubles in the next 
  article.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Game-try doubles are not used 
  after you overcall, so partner's double in (D) is penalty no matter what suit 
  the opponents bid. Partner could have&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AKJ

  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Part 8 -- Defaults for 
  cooperative doubles.</font></h3>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="2">Two-way, re-negative, 
  action, informative, cooperative . . .</font></strong>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">It sometimes seems as if modern 
  bidding systems have fallen in love with non-penalty doubles -- and that there 
  are as many different names for them as there are competitive situations.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">These doubles are used to send 
  specialized -- and sometimes very subtle -- messages in specific types of 
  auctions. One that's growing in popularity, but can be particularly difficult 
  to handle, is the cooperative double.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A cooperative double shows 
  uncertainty about whether to declare or defend; it tells partner you have good 
  defense if he wants to pass, and good offense if he wants to bid. As such, it 
  sends the potentially risky message of &quot;do the right thing, 
  partner&quot;.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some players maintain that 
  cooperative doubles don't exist at all -- that they're just excuses for making 
  undiscussed doubles that partner didn't field. That theory may be close to the 
  truth. Of all the terms used to describe competitive doubles, probably more 
  sins have been committed in the name of &quot;cooperative&quot; than any 
  other.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In practice, however, cooperative 
  doubles are used successfully by many partnerships. They can help you solve 
  many matchpoint bidding problems, but only if both partners are clear on the 
  exact conditions.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Even though the cooperative double 
  isn't technically a convention, it should be treated like one. Just as with 
  any new convention, you should define the types of auctions where it applies, 
  and avoid the temptation of using one in an undiscussed situation.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One recommendation is to limit the 
  use of cooperative doubles to auctions where:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Doubler has previously limited 
      his hand in such a way that he couldn't be positive of beating the 
      contract <strong>and</strong></font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Doubler's partner will know 
      there's a safe alternative to passing -- because the partnership has 
      already bid and raised a suit, or because doubler has shown a two-suiter 
      or one very long suit.<br>
      </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here are some situations where 
  many pairs like to play the double as cooperative:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">	<u>You      LHO      Partner    RHO 
</u>(A)     1D	 1H	   2D	     2H   
        Pass	 Pass	   DBL    

(B) 	 --	  --	   1D	   Pass  
        Pass	 DBL	   2C	    2H 
        Pass	 Pass	   DBL   

(C) 	--	  1D	   DBL	    1S
        2C	 Pass	   Pass	    2D 
        Pass	 Pass	  <i> </i>DBL    

(D) 	1NT	  2H	   2S	   Pass  
        Pass	  3H	  <i> </i>DBL 
</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (A), partner is showing a 
  maximum response with moderate heart length and probably only 4 diamonds:<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">A7&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">J64 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">J982&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K1032 
  .</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">He's asking you to pass if you 
  have good defense, but to pull to 3D if you have primarily distributional 
  strength (extra diamond length or a singleton heart).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (B), partner has bid two suits, 
  so it's unlikely he has a heart stack. Instead, he's showing a very powerful 
  hand -- most likely 3-1-5-4 -- that can beat 2H if you can contribute 
  something on defense (perhaps because you're short in his suits). If not, you 
  can pull to 2S, 3C or 3D.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Partner's takeout double in (C) 
  suggested short diamonds, and his pass of your freebid denied great strength. 
  His second double shows a maximum, probably with only 3 clubs and a doubleton 
  diamond: <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AK76&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A1093 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">J5&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K102 
  .</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (D), partner's failure to 
  double at his first turn gave you a strong clue about his defense against a 
  heart contract. His double now says he has enough strength that he's unwilling 
  to sell out to 2H undoubled. He might hold:<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">A10873&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">J6 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">Q104&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">765 
  .</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your decision is fairly easy. If 
  you have a doubleton spade, you pass. With 3-card spade support, you should 
  pull to 3S <i><strong>unless</strong></i> you have a strong heart holding.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Even without prior discussion, 
  experienced players would probably be able to work out the two-way meaning of 
  the doubles in the four auctions above. These situations are 
  &quot;obvious&quot; enough that good logic and hand-evaluation skills would 
  lead you to the right conclusion.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The message wouldn't be so clear, 
  however, in:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">	<u>You     LHO     Partner    RHO 
</u>(E)      1C	1H	  1S	  Pass 
         2C	2H	  DBL 

(F)	 --	--	  1D       2C  
         2D	4C	  DBL    </font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some pairs like to play these 
  doubles as cooperative, but since neither auction fits the requirements above, 
  I wouldn't try them without a special agreement.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (E), partner hasn't limited his 
  hand. He could have diamond shortness and strong hearts, so it's very possible 
  he has a pure penalty double. And since you've denied 3-card spade support -- 
  and partner hasn't shown a diamond fit -- it isn't obvious what your 
  &quot;safe&quot; alternative is to passing.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Unless you've agreed to play this 
  double as cooperative, you should use your broader defaults to interpret it. 
  This auction fits two of the standard defaults we discussed in previous 
  articles:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>Default</u></strong> 
    : It's a penalty double if the doubler's partner has accurately described 
    his strength and distribution; <strong><i>and</i></strong></font>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>Default</u> </strong>: 
    It's a penalty double if the doubler had a good alternative.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your auction has described your 
  strength and your spade and diamond length, so you should be able to assume 
  that partner has enough information to make a decision. And since he had other 
  ways to show extra values or search for a suit or notrump contract, his double 
  should be penalty.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Auction (F) fits another standard 
  default: &quot;It's a penalty double if we've already found our fit.&quot; My 
  regular partner, however, thinks this double should also send a two-way 
  message. Since the opponents have ostensibly shown a 10-card fit -- and the 
  auction has been jammed so high -- he believes the double here is more 
  valuable as cooperative, showing extra values and short clubs.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Several experienced players he 
  polled said they might treat it this way at the table, so perhaps this auction 
  should be an exception. I'm not yet convinced, but my partner has assured me 
  that he won't try this until we develop an agreement.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Cooperative doubles can be handy 
  tools, but they always carry some risk, so many pairs play them only at 
  matchpoints. And although cooperative doubles are most commonly used at low 
  levels, there are some 4- and 5-level doubles that can have the same meaning. 
  We'll discuss default agreements for high-level doubles in the next article.<br>
