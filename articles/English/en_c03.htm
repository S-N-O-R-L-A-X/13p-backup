  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="4">Your 2C Bidding Structure</font></strong></h2>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Part 1 -- IS this a 2C opening?</font></h3>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Back in our game's early years, 
  the experts of the day emphasized &quot;sound values&quot; in bidding. Opening 
  notrumps were 16-18 points, jump shifts were 19+, and preempts always followed 
  the rule of two and three. Every bid seemed to promise &quot;two bull 
  elephants backed up in the garage&quot; (as one of our local rubber-bridge 
  players used to say).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Today's players like to bid higher 
  and more often than Culbertson, Goren and the other bridge pioneers. As a 
  result, modern bidding has embraced lower minimums for many standard bids and 
  conventions.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One of the bids that has undergone 
  this reverse inflation is the strong two-bid. It doesn't &quot;cost&quot; 
  nearly as much to make one today as it did forty (or even twenty) years ago, 
  when it virtually guaranteed game. Back then, Goren recommended a minimum of 
  25 high-card points with a good 5-card major, 23 points with a 6-carder, and 
  21 points with a 7-carder. In a minor suit, two points more were required.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Today, most players have switched 
  to a strong-and-artificial 2C, and they open it with somewhat less than Goren 
  recommended. Some even stretch the limits to include any hand with 8 to 9 
  playing tricks.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">I still remember a long-ago club 
  game where one player opened a strong 2C with <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">5 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AQJ10987542 <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">6 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">8. In the mayhem that ensued 
  (his opponents had missed a slam), he defended his bid with some creative 
  arithmetic: adding in distribution and 2 points for each card after the fourth 
  in his suit, he counted 25 playing points. He was also quick to quote all the 
  old rules-&quot;I have 9 playing tricks, I don't have two quick losers in any 
  suit, I want to force to game ...&quot;</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you use a playing-tricks-only 
  definition like this one, your 2C openers may encompass weak, distributional 
  freaks like the hand above. However, it's a marked deviation from what most 
  players consider a &quot;standard&quot; 2C opener-and what experts recommend.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Put your hand to the test</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">So what type of hand should you 
  have for a strong 2C?</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With a balanced hand, your 
  decision is easy because you can rely on high-card points. If your range for 
  an opening 2NT is 20-22, you need 23 points to open 2C and rebid 2NT.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Unbalanced hands involve more 
  difficult decisions because you have to evaluate your hand in terms of both 
  trick-taking power and defensive strength. In making decisions about whether 
  or not to open 2C with a distributional hand, many good players 
  &quot;test&quot; their hand with some combination of the guidelines below:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Playing tricks -- </strong>at 
      least 8 &frac12; to 9 tricks if your long suit is a major; 9 &frac12; to 
      10 tricks if it's a minor.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Defensive strength -- </strong>a 
      minimum of three (preferably four) quick tricks.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Loser count -- </strong>your 
      hand's quick tricks should outnumber its losers.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>The 
      &quot;two-queens&quot; test -- </strong>Do you want to be in game if 
      partner has two queens and nothing else?</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Rebid problems -- </strong>How 
      difficult will this hand be to describe if you open it with a one-bid 
      instead of 2C?<br>
      </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Although high-card points aren't 
  the main factor in evaluating an unbalanced hand, it is important to remember 
  that strong is still the operative word in the convention's name. A strong 2C 
  should not be used to describe a preempt-type hand. In practice, your hand 
  will seldom meet many of the guidelines unless it has at least 16-18 honor 
  points.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The Quick Tricks vs. Losers Rule</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your hand doesn't necessarily have 
  to pass all five of the tests to make a 2C opening a good choice. You'll 
  always have borderline decisions where you'll have to use your judgment. But 
  if you're looking for a &quot;tie-breaker&quot; to help you choose an opening 
  bid for a strong, unbalanced hand, one of the most useful guidelines is the 
  loser count (#3 above).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Using this evaluation method, you 
  open 2C only with hands that contain more quick tricks than losers. To count 
  your quick tricks, use the standard formula (each ace or KQ combination is 1 
  quick trick; an AK is 2; an unsupported king is &frac12;; and an AQ is 1 
  &frac12;).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Note that quick tricks are not the 
  same as playing tricks. A hand with a solid 9-card suit and no other honors 
  will have nine playing tricks, but only two quick tricks (the AK) and four 
  outside losers.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">To determine your hand's total 
  losers, count one for each missing ace, king or queen in each suit of 3 cards 
  or more (up to a maximum of three in any suit). In shorter suits, count only 
  missing aces (for singletons) or aces and kings (for doubletons). Voids, 
  singleton aces, AK doubletons and suits headed by AKQ have no losers. Ax and 
  Kx are each one loser; any lower doubleton (including Qx) counts as two.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">There are a few distinctions 
  you'll want to make with this formula. Technically, suits of Axx, Kxx and Qxx 
  (or longer) each have two losers, but these obviously aren't comparable 
  holdings. For this reason, you should count a queen-high suit as three losers 
  unless it also contains the jack or it's a long suit that's likely to be 
  trumps.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Another exception is a holding of 
  AJ10(x). Even though you're missing the king and queen, this suit is usually 
  counted as only one loser because of the 75% chance of a successful double 
  finesse (this assumes, of course, that you'll be able to lead the suit from 
  partner's hand).</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Try your evaluation skills</font></h3>

      could count this as 9 playing tricks (7 diamonds and 2 spades), but you 
      should have at least 9 &frac12; when your long suit is a minor. And even 9 
      tricks is optimistic-if partner doesn't have a fit, you could easily have 
      2 (even 3) diamond losers. Since you have only 3 quick tricks and 4 
      losers, it's better to open with a 1-bid and hope to describe your playing 
      strength later in the auction.</font></dd>

      expect to make 4S opposite a 4-point hand (in this case, a Yarborough will 
      be sufficient). The losing doubleton is a liability, but that alone 
      shouldn't talk you out of opening 2C if the rest of the hand is 
      &quot;right&quot;.</font></dd>

      can't scrape up a response to 1C? Your suit is so weak that you can't 
      count playing tricks, and you have more losers (5) than quick tricks (4). 
      It's true that if partner holds the &quot;right&quot; two queens (hearts 
      and clubs), you might make 3NT, but it's seldom wise to base your decision 
      on the chance that partner has specific cards for you.</font></dd>

      hand counts to only 9 playing tricks (6 diamonds and 3 aces). However, you 
      have more quick tricks than losers, and holding all four aces is a big 
      plus. The deciding factor here is your possible rebid problems. If you 
      start with 1D and partner responds 1S, you could risk the minor distortion 
      of a 2H reverse. But what if partner instead responds 1H? The only 100% 
      forcing bids you'll have available (4NT notwithstanding) are jump shifts 
      to 2S or 3C, both of which are major distortions of your distribution.</font></dd>

  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Part 2 -- Special Problem Hands</font></h3>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The 1992 Fall NABCs in Orlando got 
  off to a rousing start when this hand was dealt in the first session of the 
  Open Pairs:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><strong>Void 
    <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">6 <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AKQJ98754

  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In first seat, with both sides 
  vulnerable, what's your call?</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The recommended opening with this 
  type of hand is 5D, or perhaps a gambling 3NT for those who play that 
  convention. Several creative souls, however, came up with more imaginative 
  calls, including a strong 2C.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Is this a psych?</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The result at many of these tables 
  was a director call when the opponents questioned the legality of the 2C 
  opening (this hand generated five committees after the session, all at tables 
  where the auction began with 2C). ACBL laws forbid psyching an opening of a 
  strong, artificial bid -- including a strong 2C and a Precision 1C -- so the 
  question before the committees was: Is this a psychic 2C opening?</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The answer depends in part on the 
  bidder's intent. If a committee believes the opener chose 2C to intentionally 
  deceive his opponents, they would probably rule it an illegal psych and adjust 
  the score. But if opener could convince the committee that he honestly 
  evaluated this hand as a legitimate strong 2-bid, the score might stand. In 
  practice, a committee would probably give a novice the benefit of the doubt, 
  but would expect an experienced player to know better.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><u>Problem #1</u>: Preempt-type 
  hands</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you and your partner consider 
  any 9-trick hand to be worth a 2C opening, then this hand might qualify as 
  &quot;legal&quot;. Whether or not it's a wise choice is another issue. This 
  hand type -- lots of playing tricks, but little defense -- is one of several 
  that create special problems when opened with a strong two-bid.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opening 2C with a hand that most 
  players would open with a 1-bid (or even a preempt) runs several risks. The 
  more immediate one is deceiving partner. On the hand above, partner will 
  average about 10 high-card points, and if he has a few quick tricks, you won't 
  be able to stop him below slam. And if your next 2C opener is a 25-pointer, 
  you'll have a hard time convincing partner that his scattering of kings and 
  queens will make a slam this time.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If your 2C opening doesn't promise 
  some minimum defensive strength, you'll also have some awkward problems when 
  the opponents compete. Responder won't be able to take strong action until 
  opener clarifies his hand type, and neither partner will be able to make a 
  forcing pass or a penalty double with any certainty.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A third, and perhaps more serious, 
  problem is that your non-standard opening may illegally mislead your 
  opponents. So even if you get a good result, it may be overturned or you may 
  incur a penalty for improper system announcement. To be sure your opponents 
  are informed about your style, you should special-alert, or even pre-alert, 
  this type of 2C opening (although there's no guarantee that this will appease 
  all committees).</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><u>Problem #2</u>: Two-suited 
  hands</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Two-suited hands, especially those 
  with both minors, are some of the most difficult to bid with the 2C convention 
  (and one of the reasons forcing-club systems were developed). Because 2C uses 
  up so much bidding space, expert players will stand on their heads to avoid 
  opening 2C with a minor two-suiter.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Consider a hand like <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">Q 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AKJ53 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KQJ74. Your first instinct 
  may be to open 2C, since you have 22 points and your quick tricks (4 &frac12;) 
  do outnumber your losers (4). An optimist might even count this as 9 &frac12; 
  tricks, but the deciding factor here is your rebid problems. To show both your 
  suits after a 2C opener, you'll have to go the 4-level, which may be too high. 
  The best way to safely and accurately describe this hand is to open 1D, then 
  jump-shift into clubs.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Even 5-4 and 6-4 minor-suited 
  hands can cause problems. If you open 2C with <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ109 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ10873 and follow with 3C, 
  what do you do over partner's 3H, 3S or 3NT rebid? You could be missing an 
  excellent diamond fit, but you don't have room to show your second suit or to 
  get a good idea of partner's strength. Better to open this hand 1C, pray for a 
  response, then reverse into diamonds.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your strategy should be different, 
  however, when you have a major two-suiter. Any of the hands above would be a 
  good 2C opener if even one of the 5+-card suits were a major. Since your first 
  rebid with these hands will usually be at the 2-level, you should have room to 
  show both your suits after a 2C opening.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><u>Problem #3</u>: Minor one-suiters</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You'll also want to make 
  distinctions between majors and minors when you hold a strong one-suiter. For 
  example, <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">Void <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KQJ10865 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AK82 <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ, 
  has 4 quick tricks, only 3 losers, and counts to 9 playing tricks -- all 
  adequate for a 2C opening with a major.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Switch the diamonds and hearts, 
  though (to <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">Void <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AK82 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KQJ10865 <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ 
  ), and you'll fare better with a 1D opening. One reason is that when you open 
  2C and show a minor suit, partner will count on you to have at least 9 
  &frac12; tricks. Another important consideration is that a 2C opener makes it 
  very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to find a 4-4 major-suit fit, which 
  is a real danger on this hand. If partner has 4 hearts, a 1D opening may be 
  the only way you'll get him to bid the suit.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><u>Problem #4</u>: Three-suited 
  hands</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The real bane of the 2C bidder's 
  existence is the strong 4-4-4-1 pattern. Players solve this problem in a 
  number of ways, one of which is to open 2NT. This works best when your 
  singleton is an honor and it's in a minor suit. With a hand like<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ93 <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AQJ4 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ105 <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K, 
  2NT is fairly safe -- partner isn't likely to be bidding a club game, and your 
  singleton king does offer a feeble stopper for notrump. Add a queen to this 
  hand, and you would open 2C and rebid 2NT.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">However, change the hand to <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">3 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AK109 <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AQJ4 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">AK75, and an opening 2NT is 
  more of a distortion. Since your singleton is a major, there's too great a 
  chance that partner will have 6-card length and insist on game (or slam) 
  there. Also, with all your honors outside the singleton, your hand becomes 
  more suitable for a trump contract. Opening 2NT opening with this type of 
  playing strength could cause you to miss a good slam.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The most common way to deal with 
  three-suited hands of up to 22 points is to start with a 1-bid. With the hand 
  above, if partner can't respond to your 1C or 1D opening, you probably haven't 
  missed anything. Even if you have, you may still find it; the opponents, who 
  rate to hold a fair number of spades, may overcall or balance.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your real dilemma comes when you 
  hold far too much strength to risk a 1-bid. With <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">3 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AKJ8 <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AK86 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">AKQ4, most players open 2C, 
  then rebid 2H (or maybe 2NT, if the singleton is a minor). These auctions 
  often require good guessing and skill in playing 4-3 fits, but thankfully, we 
  see these 4-4-4-1 powerhouses only rarely.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">There are some handy conventions 
  to make this type of hand easier to bid. One is Roman 2D, which shows a 
  4-4-4-1 with 17-24 points; opener's rebids then identify his singleton. 
  Another interesting approach is to play a jump rebid by the 2C opener shows 
  this pattern with a singleton in the next higher suit (with the above hand, 
  the auction 2C-2D-3H would show the singleton spade).</font>

  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Think about the last time you 
  filled out a convention card with a new partner. You might have gotten into 
  long, involved conversations about once-in-a-lifetime conventions, but when 
  you came to the part of the card for 2C opening bids, the discussion may have 
  been over in two seconds. Typically, one person will say

  you're done with it.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Even serious partnerships often

  is responder's conventional responses and rebids. The once-common 2D negative 
  response (which showed 0-7 points) is used by few players today. Modern 
  bidding has given us lots of new choices, each with advantages and 
  disadvantages.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When designing your system, it's 
  often helpful to find out which conventions and treatments are popular among 
  good players. Some interesting answers came from a survey of players who read 
  the Usenet newsgroup rec.games.bridge on the Internet computer network. This 
  group isn't representative of bridge players as a whole (their average age is 
  37), but most are fairly experienced players who have studied bidding theory. 
  Those who answered the survey ranged from intermediate-level players to world 
  champions.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When asked what general structure 
  they used for responses to a strong 2C in their favorite partnership, they 
  offered the following answers (with the percentage of &quot;votes&quot; for 
  each):</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">36% -- 2D semi-positive, 2H 
      immediate double negative</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">25% -- Control-showing step 
      responses</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">21% -- 2D waiting, cheaper 
      minor second negative</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">10% -- 2D negative, 2H 
      balanced positive</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">4% -- Point-count step 
      responses</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">4% -- Other artificial systems</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here's a quick look at the three 
  most popular responding structures:</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">2D waiting (or 
  &quot;semi-automatic&quot;)</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With this widely used approach, 
  responder almost always bids 2D to give the 2C opener maximum room to describe 
  his hand. Exceptions are rare; responder bids his own suit only when it's very 
  strong and he has otherwise positive values. Most partnerships also include a 
  way for responder to show an ultra-weak, &quot;second-negative&quot; hand 
  later -- usually by bidding the cheaper minor (some also use cheapest suit or 
  2NT).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The advantages of 2D waiting are 
  that it's simple and it saves bidding space. The drawback is that responder 
  has fewer opportunities to describe his strength and suit length, and may find 
  it difficult to catch up later in the auction.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Control-showing responses</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This approach is popular because 
  it allows responder to show his most important cards (aces and kings) 
  immediately, all in one bid. Counting each king as one control and each ace as 
  two, responder makes one of the following step responses:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">2D = 0 or 1 control</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">2H = 2 controls</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">2S = 1 ace and 1 king (3 
      controls)</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">2NT = 3 kings (3 controls)</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">3C = 4 controls</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">There are many variations, 
  including one that incorporates point-count into the first two steps -- both 
  2D and 2H show 0 or 1 control, but 2D limits the hand to 0-4 points and 2H 
  promises 5+ (or some players use 0-5 and 6+ point ranges). 2S becomes the 
  2-control response and the other steps are modified accordingly.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The disadvantages of control 
  responses are that responder loses the ability to make a natural call at his 
  first turn and may use up extra bidding space, which can make the later 
  auction somewhat tricky. But since the higher steps show slam-oriented 
  responding hands, most partnerships don't worry too much about losing an early 
  level of bidding.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A few players define the steps by 
  just point-count, but this has little value because it makes no distinction 
  between jacks and aces. The 2C opener seldom has any need for knowing his 
  partner's total points; information on aces and kings is much more helpful.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">2D semi-positive; 2H double 
  negative</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This is similar to 2D waiting, 
  with the exception that responder uses an immediate 2H response to show a 
  &quot;double-negative&quot; hand (fewer than 2 queens). A response of 2D, 
  then, is semi-positive, promising at least two queens or a king.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This offers several advantages. 
  Responder's 2H gives opener immediate information about game prospects and 
  makes it easier for you to stop in a part score when it's right. Since the 2D 
  response shows forcing-to-game values, both partners can keep the auction low. 
  Also, there's no need for a second-negative response later, so all of 
  responder's rebids are natural.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Since 2H isn't available as a 
  natural call, 2NT is used to show a positive response with hearts (5+ cards to 
  2 of the top 3 honors). A better alternative to this is &quot;reverse 
  transfers&quot;, where 2S shows a heart positive, and 2NT shows a spade 
  positive. This makes the strong hand declarer if responder's suit becomes 
  trumps.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Defining your other responses</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you've decided to use 
  control-showing responses, responder has few other choices for his first bid. 
  Those who have adopted other systems need to discuss the meanings of all the 
  other possible bids responder might make.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">For those who play 2D as waiting, 
  negative or semi-positive, here are the standard meanings (and some popular 
  variations) for responder's other bids:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Suit response</strong> 
      (2H, 2S, 3C, 3D): Most partnerships require responder to have a 
      near-perfect hand for this bid: at least 5 cards, two of the top three 
      honors, and otherwise positive values. AQxxx and out isn't enough, 
      especially if it's a minor.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Jump in a suit </strong>(3H, 
      3S, 4C, 4D): Many pairs haven't discussed responder's jump, but some play 
      it as a 6-card or longer suit headed by AKQ. A more useful agreement is to 
      define it as a long, strong suit missing the ace or king, with no outside 
      controls (something like a good weak two-bid).</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>2NT:</strong> This 
      usually shows a balanced 8-10 or 9-11 points (or, for those who you play 
      2D semi-positive and reverse transfers, a good spade suit). In practice, 
      it's rarely used as a natural bid because it eats up so much space. 
      Several of the Usenet players said the only time they would respond a 
      natural 2NT would be with a hand with good tenaces, soft values and few 
      controls.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>3NT:</strong> Although 
      the standard definition is a balanced 11-12, many of those surveyed said 
      they would never respond 3NT. Instead, some use it to show an unspecified 
      long, solid suit.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Note that few players use the old 
  &quot;game-in-hand&quot; requirement anymore, so an opening 2C isn't 100% 
  forcing to game. You should, however, agree that unless the 2C opener rebids 
  2NT, the auction is forced to at least 3 of a major.</font>

  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The standard way to start the 
  description all five hands is to open 2C, then rebid 2S. But with such wide 
  differences in trump quality, playing tricks and defensive strength among 
  these hands, a 2S rebid doesn't begin to give partner a good picture. You'll 
  usually need at least one or two more bids to clarify which hand type you 
  hold.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The problem comes if you and your 
  partner haven't assigned clear meanings to the 2C opener's later rebids. With 
  Hands #2 through #5, for example, you'll have enough room to rebid spades two 
  or three times. But since these are really four different hand types, do you 
  have four different ways to show them?</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">To solve this problem, many 
  players have added a few simple agreements that allow the 2C opener to more 
  accurately describe hands like these with his first and second rebids. They 
  take advantage of jumps to the three and four levels to distinguish between 
  solid and non-solid suits and maximum and minimum playing strength.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Non-jump suit bid (2C-2D-2H / 2S 
  / 3C / 3D)</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This starts the description of a 
  &quot;standard&quot; 2C opener (Hand #1 above). If opener's first rebid is a 
  major, it shows either a 5-card suit or a longer, non-solid suit. If it's a 
  minor, it strongly implies a 6-card or longer suit (which may or may not be 
  solid).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Note that even though opener needs 
  only a 5-card suit for this auction, it tends to imply a one-suited or 
  distributional hand. For more balanced hands, even those with a 5-card major, 
  you may want to choose a notrump rebid instead. With a hand like <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ1052 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AQJ <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ10, opening 2C and 
  rebidding 2S wouldn't be incorrect. Many players, however, would rebid 2NT to 
  emphasize the balanced strength, take advantage of the good tenaces, and limit 
  their point count.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">To show extra length (Hand #2), 
  opener rebids his suit at his next turn. This auction -- 2C-2D / 2S-3C / 
  3S-shows a 6-card or longer suit, but does not insist that it be trumps. The 
  final contract is still open to negotiation and may be in notrump or partner's 
  suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">For hands with more powerful (but 
  not solid) suits and playing strength (Hand #3), opener starts with the 
  low-level rebid, then jumps to game at his third turn. This auction -- 2C-2D / 
  2S-3D / 4S-sets trumps, but tells partner your suit has a loser. Any further 
  bid by responder (even in a suit he's shown earlier in the auction) is a 
  cuebid for slam in opener's suit.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Jump to 3 of a major 
  (2C-2D-3H/3S)</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One good agreement for opener's 
  jump is to use it for a powerhouse with long, solid trumps and good controls 
  (Hand #4). It sets trumps and promises a suit that should play for no losers 
  opposite a singleton -- at least AKQJxx or AKQxxxx (or AKJxxxxx if you have 
  the courage). This agreement can also extend to minors, but because a jump to 
  4C or 4D uses up so much bidding room (and takes you past 3NT), you should 
  have an exceptional hand to use it.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After opener's jump, responder 
  cuebids his cheapest ace or king. Without one, he raises to 4 of opener's suit 
  with a potential ruffing value (at least a doubleton trump and an outside 
  doubleton). With no controls and no ruffing value, responder rebids 3NT. This 
  will never be the final contract (opener will always go back to his suit), but 
  it warns partner that your hand isn't suitable for any higher contracts.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can see how well this works 
  with Hand #4 above. After 2C-2D-3S, if responder answers with 3NT, 4H or 4S, 
  you'll know he has neither of the kings you need and you can stop safely in 
  game. If he instead bids 4D (showing the diamond king but not the club king), 
  you'll bid 6S. And if he bids 4C over your jump, you can look for the grand 
  slam -- you'll follow with a 4H cuebid and if partner can now bid 5D to show a 
  second king, you can bid your almost-laydown 7S.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Other uses for opener's jump 
  (2C-2D-3H/3S/4C/4D)</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Another interesting treatment is 
  to use opener's jump to show a 4-4-4-1 hand. To identify his singleton, opener 
  jumps into the suit directly below it -- 2C-2D-3S shows a singleton club, 
  2C-2D-4D shows a singleton heart.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Other players are successful in 
  using jumps to pinpoint two-suited hands. The method you and your partner 
  choose depends on your personal preference. The key is to decide on some 
  useful meaning for opener's jump and not leave it as an idle bid.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Jump to game in a major 
  (2C-2D-4H/4S)</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opener's immediate jump to game 
  shows a minimum with 9-10 playing tricks and long, solid trumps. It tells 
  partner your 2C opening was based more on playing strength than high-card 
  points and warns him against bidding on unless he has excellent controls.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">As with the jump to 3 of the 
  major, there's no looking for new trump suits after this auction. Any further 
  bid by responder is a cuebid for slam in opener's suit. Responder should pass 
  with just kings and queens, but bid on with a hand that could potentially 
  contribute two tricks. After 2C-2D-4S, you should pass with <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">763 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ4 <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K9 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ1093. However, a hand like <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">3 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">1086543 <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K9 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">A1053 is worth a 5C cuebid.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Handling interference</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With more and more opponents 
  willing to overcall after 2C opening, it's also important to discuss how 
  you'll handle competition. There are a number of different approaches you can 
  use after an opponent makes a direct overcall of your opening 2C. One simple 
  set of agreements for responder's bids is:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>New suit</strong> = A 
      strong suit (two of the top three honors, usually with 6+ cards).</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Cuebid</strong> = 
      Positive response, 4-4-4-1 distribution, singleton in the overcalled suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Pass</strong> = Any 
      other semi-positive hand (two queens or better).</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Double </strong>= 
      Immediate double-negative (less than two queens).<br>
      </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Most frequently, responder will 
  pass the overcall and let opener describe his hand. After the auction:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">  <u> You     LHO    Partner   RHO </u> 
   2C      2H      Pass     Pass   
</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">the meanings of opener's rebids 
  can be:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>New suit</strong> (2S, 
      3C, 3D) = One-suited hand. Jumps (to 3S and 4S) can carry the same 
      meanings as described above.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>2NT </strong>= 
      Two-suit takeout. Responder bids the cheapest suit he's willing to play 
      in; if opener corrects, it shows the other two suits.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Cuebid</strong> (3H) = 
      Three-suit takeout (4-4-4-1, singleton or void in the opponent's suit).</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Double</strong> = A 
      strong notrump hand. This shows balanced distribution, but doesn't have to 
      promise a stopper in the overcalled suit. Responder can pass for penalties 
      or bid on with standard notrump sequences (Stayman and transfers).<br>
      </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If the overcall instead comes on 
  opener's right, as in:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">   <u> You     LHO    Partner   RHO  </u> 
    2C      Pass    2D       2S    </font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">you can use the same agreements as 
  above for opener's new suit, cuebid and 2NT bids. A direct double, however, 
  should be penalty, since opener can make a forcing pass to show a fairly 
  balanced hand.</font>
