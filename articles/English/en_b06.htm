      <font size="2">After an opponent opens, it's
        often difficult to describe a hand with two long suits. The auction may get
        too high (or end too soon) for you to show both, or you may not have the
        strength to safely bid <b>either</b> suit. Consider these problems if RHO
        opens:</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">With <b>(A)</b>, you would
        overcall 1S and hope to bid hearts later. With <b>(B)</b> and <b>(C)</b>, it
        may be dangerous to bid at all, especially at the 2-level. Both hands have
        good playing strength, but neither can be described with a standard overcall,
        which tends to show a one-suited hand with more high-card points.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The <b>Michaels Cuebid</b> and <b>Unusual
          Notrump</b> are conventions that let you show two suits with one bid. The

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This is a direct cuebid of the
        opponent's opened suit (1C by RHO, 2C by you) to show 5+-card length in two
        other suits. One of your suits is always a major, but the exact two you
        promise depend on the opening bid:</font>

        <font size="2">Unusual 2NT</font>
      </b></h2>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This convention is a direct jump
        to 2NT over an&nbsp; opponent's opening bid (1H by RHO, 2NT by you) to show
        the <b>two lower-ranking unbid suits</b>. You should have at least 5 cards in
        each suit for this bid. One of your suits is always a minor, but the exact two
        you promise depend on the opening bid:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Over a <b>1C </b>opening, 2NT

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>In the example hands above</b>,
        Hand <b>(A) </b>is perfect for a Michaels Cuebid. With <b>(B)</b>, an Unusual
        2NT shows both suits without promising great high-card strength. And with <b>(C)</b>,
        your overcall depends on which suit the opponent opened -- over 1S, you would
        bid 2S Michaels to show the other major and a minor; over 1C, you would use
        the Unusual 2NT to show the two lower unbid suits.<br>

        <font size="2">Strength requirements</font>
      </b></h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The strength you promise for these
        overcalls is about 7+ pts., but suit quality and playing strength are more
        important than high-card points. Michaels Cuebids and Unusual Notrump
        overcalls are usually preemptive in nature -- they show good suits and
        distributional values, but don't necessarily promise the high-card strength of
        a regular overcall. They can, however, be used with stronger hands where you
        want to force partner to choose one of your suits. Over an opponent's 1D
        opener, for example, you can bid 2D Michaels with&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13"
          height="11"><b>AKQ98&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KQJ92&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif"
            width="13" height="11">K5&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">7</b>,
        and then jump to game in the major partner bids.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Some players prefer to make a
        simple major-suit overcall with hands with intermediate strength (10-15 pts.).
        They use the Michaels cuebid only for hands that are weak (5-9 pts.) or very
        strong (good enough to jump to game once partner shows his preference).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In general, though, the best rule
        is to just use your judgment. Decide if you want to emphasize one suit
        (usually a major) with a simple overcall, or if you want to bring two suits
        into the picture immediately with a Michaels Cuebid or Unusual Notrump. For
        example:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Over a 1D opener, it's
            probably best to overcall 1H with&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>8&nbsp;&nbsp;<img
                src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ976&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13"
                height="11">53&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ1043</b>.&nbsp;
            You could use the Unusual 2NT, but this would force partner to bid at the
            3-level, which may be too high.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">If there's great disparity in
            the strength of your two suits, it may be better to overcall one of them
            instead. Over 1H by RHO, if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13"
              height="11"><b>KQJ98&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif"
                width="13" height="11">J10654&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">43</b>,
            a 1S overcall is a better description than a Michaels Cuebid.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><b>
        <font size="2">Other uses</font>
      </b></h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">These conventions are most
        commonly used in direct seat over an opponent's opening bid, but can apply in
        other types of auctions, too. If an opening bid is passed around to you, you
        can balance with a Michaels Cuebid or Unusual 2NT. For example, after 1C by
        LHO-Pass-Pass, <b>2C</b> by you would be Michaels, showing both majors. After
        1H-Pass-Pass, a bid of <b>2NT</b> is Unusual, showing both minors.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">You can also play that any
        &quot;unusual&quot; notrump overcall (even if it's not a jump) is the Unusual
        Notrump. For example, after 1H by LHO-Pass-2H, <b>2NT</b> by you shows both
        minors (similarly, 1H-Pass-2H-3H is Michaels, showing spades and a minor).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Notrump overcalls at higher levels
        also convey this meaning: 1D by LHO-Pass-3D-3NT by you shows clubs and hearts.&nbsp;
        1S-Pass-4S-4NT shows both minors. The higher the level, the stronger and more
        distributional your hand should be for your bid.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><b>
        <font size="2">Use your judgment</font>
      </b></h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Like all bids, these overcalls
        give information to both your partner <b><i>and</i></b> the opponents. If you
        don't buy the contract, your bid may work against you because it gives
        declarer an almost perfect picture of your distribution. For this reason, you
        should only use these bids when your hand meets all the requirements for suit
        length and playing strength.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Be careful if your high-card
        strength is outside your suits. With a hand like&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13"
          height="11"><b>K&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A6&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13"
            height="11">J9853&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">Q7632</b>
        , your suits are too weak for a 2NT overcall.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Vulnerability should also affect
        your decision. Since partner is often forced to bid at the 3-level (sometimes
        with only 2-card support), a <b><i>vulnerable</i></b> Michaels or Unusual 2NT
        should promise more playing strength--&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13"

        <font size="2">Responding bids</font>
      </b></h2>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Remember that partner's Michaels
        Cuebid or 2NT overcall is artificial. If your RHO passes, you <b><i>cannot</i></b>
        pass. For all Unusual 2NT overcalls and most Michaels Cuebids, you'll know the
        exact two suits partner holds, so bid your longer one. You should almost
        always bid one of partner's suits; <b><i>don't</i></b> be tempted to suggest
        any other suit as trumps unless you have <b><i>great</i></b> length and
        strength in it.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The <b><i>level</i></b> of your
        bid depends on your strength and trump support. With a weak-to-intermediate
        hand, bid at the lowest level available. With a stronger hand, you can jump in
        one of partner's suits to invite game or jump directly to game.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If RHO makes an intervening bid,
        you should compete if you have some strength and support for one of partner's
        suits. Partner is promising 5-5 in his suits, so any 3-card holding is good
        support.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If you're not vulnerable and you
        have a weak hand with strong support, you may want to sacrifice. Suppose LHO
        opens 1H, partner overcalls 2H (spades and a minor), and you hold&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13"
          height="11"><b>J964&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">5&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif"
            width="13" height="11">A872&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">J874</b>
        . You know the opponents can make at least 4H, so if you're not vulnerable,
        you should sacrifice right away by jumping to 4S. With your long trumps and
        singleton (and filler in whatever partner's minor is), a spade contract should
        make at least 8 or 9 (and maybe 10) tricks.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><b>
        <font size="2">Finding partner's unknown suit</font>
      </b></h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The one case where you won't know
        partner's exact two suits is when he makes a Michaels Cuebid over a 1H or 1S
        opening (showing the other major and an unspecified minor). Since you know his
        major, you can bid it if you have 3+-card (or 2-card) support. If you can't
        support his major but have at least 3-card length in <b><i>both</i></b>
        minors, you'll want to play in his minor suit. To ask partner which minor he
        holds -- and tell him that's your preferred trump suit -- bid <b><i>2NT</i></b>.
        Partner will bid his long minor and you can then pass, raise or sacrifice.<br>
