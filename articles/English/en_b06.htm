  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After an opponent opens, it's 
  often difficult to describe a hand with two long suits. The auction may get 
  too high (or end too soon) for you to show both, or you may not have the 
  strength to safely bid <b>either</b> suit. Consider these problems if RHO 
  opens:</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>(A)&nbsp; </b>RHO opens 1C or 
  1D and you hold:&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>KQ964&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ872&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">52&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">7</b><br>
  <b>(B)&nbsp; </b>RHO opens 1H or 1S and you hold:&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>765&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">Void&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K10765&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ1093</b><br>
  <b>(C)&nbsp; </b>RHO opens 1C or 1S and you hold:&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ872&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ10754&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">5</b></font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With <b>(A)</b>, you would 
  overcall 1S and hope to bid hearts later. With <b>(B)</b> and <b>(C)</b>, it 
  may be dangerous to bid at all, especially at the 2-level. Both hands have 
  good playing strength, but neither can be described with a standard overcall, 
  which tends to show a one-suited hand with more high-card points.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The <b>Michaels Cuebid</b> and <b>Unusual 
  Notrump</b> are conventions that let you show two suits with one bid. The 
  convention you use depends on which suit the opponent opens and which suits 
  you have.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <hr>
  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Michaels Cuebid</font></b></h2>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This is a direct cuebid of the 
  opponent's opened suit (1C by RHO, 2C by you) to show 5+-card length in two 
  other suits. One of your suits is always a major, but the exact two you 
  promise depend on the opening bid:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Over a <b>minor-suit opening</b>, 
      a Michaels Cuebid (1C-2C or 1D-2D) shows <b>both majors</b>.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Over a <b>major-suit opening</b>, 
      a Michaels Cuebid (1H-2H or 1S-2S) shows <b>the OTHER major <i>and</i> an 
      unspecified minor</b>.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The Michaels Cuebid replaces the 
  Goren-style Strong Cuebid. If you have a very strong hand, you must start with 
  a takeout double.</font>
  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Unusual 2NT</font></b></h2>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This convention is a direct jump 
  to 2NT over an&nbsp; opponent's opening bid (1H by RHO, 2NT by you) to show 
  the <b>two lower-ranking unbid suits</b>. You should have at least 5 cards in 
  each suit for this bid. One of your suits is always a minor, but the exact two 
  you promise depend on the opening bid:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Over a <b>1C </b>opening, 2NT 
      shows <b>diamonds</b> <b>and hearts</b>.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Over a <b>1D&nbsp; </b>opening, 
      2NT shows <b>clubs</b> <b>and</b> <b>hearts</b>.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Over a <b>1H</b> or <b>1S </b>opening, 
      2NT shows <b>both</b> <b>minors</b>.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>In the example hands above</b>, 
  Hand <b>(A) </b>is perfect for a Michaels Cuebid. With <b>(B)</b>, an Unusual 
  2NT shows both suits without promising great high-card strength. And with <b>(C)</b>, 
  your overcall depends on which suit the opponent opened -- over 1S, you would 
  bid 2S Michaels to show the other major and a minor; over 1C, you would use 
  the Unusual 2NT to show the two lower unbid suits.<br>
  </font>
  <hr width="100%">
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Strength requirements</font></b></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The strength you promise for these 
  overcalls is about 7+ pts., but suit quality and playing strength are more 
  important than high-card points. Michaels Cuebids and Unusual Notrump 
  overcalls are usually preemptive in nature -- they show good suits and 
  distributional values, but don't necessarily promise the high-card strength of 
  a regular overcall. They can, however, be used with stronger hands where you 
  want to force partner to choose one of your suits. Over an opponent's 1D 
  opener, for example, you can bid 2D Michaels with&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>AKQ98&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KQJ92&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K5&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">7</b>, 
  and then jump to game in the major partner bids.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some players prefer to make a 
  simple major-suit overcall with hands with intermediate strength (10-15 pts.). 
  They use the Michaels cuebid only for hands that are weak (5-9 pts.) or very 
  strong (good enough to jump to game once partner shows his preference).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In general, though, the best rule 
  is to just use your judgment. Decide if you want to emphasize one suit 
  (usually a major) with a simple overcall, or if you want to bring two suits 
  into the picture immediately with a Michaels Cuebid or Unusual Notrump. For 
  example:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Over a 1D opener, it's 
      probably best to overcall 1H with&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>8&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ976&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">53&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ1043</b>.&nbsp; 
      You could use the Unusual 2NT, but this would force partner to bid at the 
      3-level, which may be too high.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If there's great disparity in 
      the strength of your two suits, it may be better to overcall one of them 
      instead. Over 1H by RHO, if you have&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>KQJ98&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">J10654&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">43</b>, 
      a 1S overcall is a better description than a Michaels Cuebid.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Other uses</font></b></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">These conventions are most 
  commonly used in direct seat over an opponent's opening bid, but can apply in 
  other types of auctions, too. If an opening bid is passed around to you, you 
  can balance with a Michaels Cuebid or Unusual 2NT. For example, after 1C by 
  LHO-Pass-Pass, <b>2C</b> by you would be Michaels, showing both majors. After 
  1H-Pass-Pass, a bid of <b>2NT</b> is Unusual, showing both minors.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can also play that any 
  &quot;unusual&quot; notrump overcall (even if it's not a jump) is the Unusual 
  Notrump. For example, after 1H by LHO-Pass-2H, <b>2NT</b> by you shows both 
  minors (similarly, 1H-Pass-2H-3H is Michaels, showing spades and a minor).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Notrump overcalls at higher levels 
  also convey this meaning: 1D by LHO-Pass-3D-3NT by you shows clubs and hearts.&nbsp; 
  1S-Pass-4S-4NT shows both minors. The higher the level, the stronger and more 
  distributional your hand should be for your bid.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Use your judgment</font></b></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Like all bids, these overcalls 
  give information to both your partner <b><i>and</i></b> the opponents. If you 
  don't buy the contract, your bid may work against you because it gives 
  declarer an almost perfect picture of your distribution. For this reason, you 
  should only use these bids when your hand meets all the requirements for suit 
  length and playing strength.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Be careful if your high-card 
  strength is outside your suits. With a hand like&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>K&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A6&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">J9853&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">Q7632</b> 
  , your suits are too weak for a 2NT overcall.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Vulnerability should also affect 
  your decision. Since partner is often forced to bid at the 3-level (sometimes 
  with only 2-card support), a <b><i>vulnerable</i></b> Michaels or Unusual 2NT 
  should promise more playing strength--&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>AQJ97&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ1082&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">42&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">4</b>&nbsp; 
  <b><i>or&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"></i>Void&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ1084&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">65&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">A98732</b>

  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Responding bids</font></b></h2>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Remember that partner's Michaels 
  Cuebid or 2NT overcall is artificial. If your RHO passes, you <b><i>cannot</i></b> 
  pass. For all Unusual 2NT overcalls and most Michaels Cuebids, you'll know the 
  exact two suits partner holds, so bid your longer one. You should almost 
  always bid one of partner's suits; <b><i>don't</i></b> be tempted to suggest 
  any other suit as trumps unless you have <b><i>great</i></b> length and 
  strength in it.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The <b><i>level</i></b> of your 
  bid depends on your strength and trump support. With a weak-to-intermediate 
  hand, bid at the lowest level available. With a stronger hand, you can jump in 
  one of partner's suits to invite game or jump directly to game.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If RHO makes an intervening bid, 
  you should compete if you have some strength and support for one of partner's 
  suits. Partner is promising 5-5 in his suits, so any 3-card holding is good 
  support.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you're not vulnerable and you 
  have a weak hand with strong support, you may want to sacrifice. Suppose LHO 
  opens 1H, partner overcalls 2H (spades and a minor), and you hold&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>J964&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">5&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">A872&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">J874</b> 
  . You know the opponents can make at least 4H, so if you're not vulnerable, 
  you should sacrifice right away by jumping to 4S. With your long trumps and 
  singleton (and filler in whatever partner's minor is), a spade contract should 
  make at least 8 or 9 (and maybe 10) tricks.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Finding partner's unknown suit</font></b></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The one case where you won't know 
  partner's exact two suits is when he makes a Michaels Cuebid over a 1H or 1S 
  opening (showing the other major and an unspecified minor). Since you know his 
  major, you can bid it if you have 3+-card (or 2-card) support. If you can't 
  support his major but have at least 3-card length in <b><i>both</i></b> 
  minors, you'll want to play in his minor suit. To ask partner which minor he 
  holds -- and tell him that's your preferred trump suit -- bid <b><i>2NT</i></b>. 
  Partner will bid his long minor and you can then pass, raise or sacrifice.<br>
