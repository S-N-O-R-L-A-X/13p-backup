  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="4">Opening Three-Bids -- </font></strong><font size="4">for 
  weak hands with long, strong suits.</font></h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">An opening Three-Bid, called a <i><b>preempt</b></i>, 
  shows a weak hand can take five or more tricks if your suit is trumps, but is 
  unlikely to take any tricks in any other suits. To open (or overcall) a 
  Three-Bid, you should have:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A good, long suit (6 or 7 
      cards, with at least two honors).</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">No ace or king in any other 
      suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">No 4-card major (especially if 
      partner is not yet a passed hand).<br>
      </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Always consider the 
  vulnerability</strong>. If you're vulnerable (your side has made a game), the 
  penalties for not making your contract are much higher. Open a <strong>vulnerable 
  </strong>Three-Bid only if you have strong 7-card suit. Here are some example 
  hands:</font>

      You have too much strength outside your suit to open 3C, which would make 
      it almost impossible to find a heart fit if you have one. This hand may be

  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responding to a Three-Bid</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If partner opens a Three-Bid, it's 
  up to you to place the contract. With a weak hand and no fit, you pass. With a 
  stronger hand, don't count just points -- what's important is the<b> <i>number 
  of tricks</i></b> you can take. Consider the vulnerability and try to 
  visualize partner's hand, then count your potential tricks.</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A bid of game in partner's 
      suit or notrump</b> (3H-<strong>4H</strong> or 3D-<strong>3NT</strong>) 
      shows a strong playing hand with a fit and quick tricks (aces and kings).</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A new suit response</b> 
      (3C-<strong>3S</strong>) shows a strong hand and a good, usually 6+-card 
      suit. Partner won't have 4-card support (even 3-card support is unlikely), 
      so don't suggest a new suit unless you have a very good one.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A simple raise below game</b> 
      (3C-<strong>4C</strong>) shows a trump fit, but no interest in game. You 
      may raise to put pressure on the opponents, to compete for the contract or 
      to sacrifice. A raise does <i><b>not</b></i> invite partner to bid again.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The Sacrifice</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A Three-Bid can be valuable when 
  you want to &quot;steal&quot; the hand with a sacrifice. If the opponents bid 
  game, you bid higher in partner's suit, hoping to get a smaller minus score 
  than if the opponents had made game.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">For a sacrifice to be profitable, 
  your hand must be weak enough in high cards for you to be sure the opponents 
  can make a game. Your hand must also be strong enough in playing tricks and 
  trump support for you to be sure you won't be set more than two (sometimes 
  three) tricks.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The best time for a sacrifice is 
  when you are <i><b>not</b></i> vulnerable and the opponents are-when their 
  game would give them a 700-pt. rubber. You can then afford to be doubled and 
  go down as many as three tricks (losing 500 pts.) for your sacrifice to be 
  profitable.</font>

      You know the opponents are short in spades and that they can surely make 
      at least 4H or 5C (or even 3NT) if you let them bid it. Your 4S bid is an 
      &quot;advance&quot; sacrifice-it uses up bidding space before the
