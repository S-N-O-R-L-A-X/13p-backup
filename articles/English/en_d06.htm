  <hr width="100%">
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One trait that all expert bridge 
  players have in common is the ability -- and the energy -- to &quot;count 
  out&quot; every hand they play. Counting involves using all the available 
  clues from the bidding and play to count the high-card points in the unseen 
  hands and count the number of cards each player holds in each suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some of it is guesswork, but if 
  you put some effort into it and draw the correct inferences, you can often 
  come up with an extremely accurate picture of where all the cards are. And the 
  more you practice, the easier it gets.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This hand is an interesting 
  example of the benefits that come from paying attention and drawing the 
  correct inferences. My partner, Tom Kniest of St. Louis, used all the evidence 
  available to get an accurate count on the hand and bring home a difficult game 
  contract.<br>

  <b>Opening Lead: </b>Six of Spades.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Tom (South) thought his 4-card 
  suit was strong enough for a 1-level overcall, so he bid 1H over East's 1D 
  opening. My 2D cuebid showed at least 3-card heart support and asked how good 
  his overcall was. With the well-placed diamond king and the opponents bidding 
  his singleton, Tom liked his hand. He saw no point in bidding the clubs, so he 
  showed a little extra with a freebid of 3H, which I raised to game.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Tom backed up his judgment with 
  careful declarer play to make his thin game. He won the spade opening lead in 
  dummy and ruffed a spade in his hand, then led a diamond to dummy's ace for 
  another spade ruff. When he now cashed the AK of trumps, he had all the 
  information he needed about the opponents' distribution.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">East had shown up with 3 hearts 
  and presumably 4 spades (if spades had been 6-3, West would surely have bid 
  his spades again over the 3H bid). It also appeared that East had at least 4 
  diamonds, because if he had held 3-3 in the minors, he would have opened 1C.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">That left East with 1 or 2 cards 
  in the critical club suit, but which ones? Tom had also been counting the 
  high-card points, and he was virtually certain East had a singleton or 
  doubleton club honor for two reasons:<br>
  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)</b>&nbsp; Without the club ace or king, East would 
  have at best a poor 10-count, not enough for an opening bid; <b>and</b>,<br>
  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)</b>&nbsp; If West had held AKx(x) of clubs, he would 
  probably have led one of the honors on opening lead.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With that picture of the layout, 
  Tom led the Club Queen from his hand, guaranteeing only two club losers if 
  East held Ax, Kx or a singleton honor in the suit. West won the club ace and 
  led a diamond to Tom's king. Tom now played East for the doubleton honor by 
  leading a low club and ducking in dummy, which collected the now-singleton 
  king. East could cash his trump queen, but dummy was up and Tom scored his 
  +420.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Bidding Tip</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">An overcall usually promises a 
  5-card suit, but competing with a 4-card suit can be good strategy when you 
  have the right type of hand. <b>Consider making an overcall with a 4-card suit 
  if you have:</b></font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A strong suit</b> -- 
      usually three of the top five honors (KQ104,&nbsp; AQJ7,&nbsp; AJ107), or 
      two of the top three honors with good &quot;body&quot; (high spot cards in 
      suits like AK98,&nbsp; KQ97,&nbsp; AQ87).</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A ruffing value</b> -- an 
      outside singleton or doubleton.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Good outside strength </b>-- 
      quick tricks and well-placed honors.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A hand pattern not suitable 
      for a takeout double</b> -- shortness in an unbid suit, for example.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Room to bid your suit at 
      the 1-level</b> (2-level overcalls on 4-card suits are reserved for those 
      with death wishes).</font></li>
