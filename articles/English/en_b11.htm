  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">The Drury Convention</font></h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The Drury Convention -- used by a 
  passed hand after partner opens 1H or 1S in third or fourth seat -- is an 
  artificial 2C response that shows a maximum raise with 3+-card support. It's a 
  very valuable convention that comes up frequently, is easy to remember and can 
  dramatically improve your bidding accuracy. Here's the type of problem it 
  solves:</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>J43&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A75&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ532&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">64</b> 
      -- You pass and partner opens 1S in third seat. Without Drury, you have a 
      choice of four possibly disastrous responses:</font>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>1 - </b>You make a 
      limit-raise to 3S and go down because partner opened light.<br>
      <b>2 - </b>You raise conservatively to 2S, partner passes, and you make 10 
      tricks because he had a full opener.&nbsp;<br>
      <b>3 -</b> You bid 1NT (forcing or standard), partner passes, and you get 
      a poor score because the rest of the field is playing in their 8-card 
      spade fit.&nbsp;<br>
      <b>4 -</b> You try a &quot;temporizing&quot; 2D, partner passes and you 
      get an even worse score.</font></dd>
  </dl>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A Drury 2C response shows your 
  support and strength right away, allowing you to bid your hand's full value 
  without getting too high. It gives you a built-in safety valve if partner has 
  opened light and it helps opener evaluate chances for game.</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Drury is used only when you're 
      a passed hand and partner has opened a major in third or fourth seat. If 
      you have 6-9 points, you make your normal raise to 2 of the major. If 
      you're stronger, you use the Drury 2C response, which always shows:</font>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>1 - </b>At least 3-card 
      support for partner's major.</font>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>2 - </b>A maximum passed 
      hand (10+ support pts.).</font></dd>
  </dl>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><u><font size="2">Two-Way Drury</font></u></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some pairs use a form of Drury 
  called &quot;Two-Way&quot;, where a 2C response shows exactly 3-card support 
  and a 2D response promises 4+-card support. This takes away your ability to 
  make a natural 2C <b><i>or </i></b>2D response, but the information about the 
  extra trump can often improve opener's ability to evaluate game chances.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Yet another treatment is 
  &quot;Two-Way Reverse Drury&quot;, where 2C shows the 4-card raise and 2D 
  shows the 3-card raise. This approach seems inferior for a number of reasons.&nbsp; 
  One is that if you're going to use up the extra bidding room with 2D instead 
  of 2C, it ought to tell opener something extra about your hand. This bidding 
  space may be needed when opener has a full, but minimum opener (12-13 pts.). 
  If you use &quot;normal&quot; Two-Way Drury and bid 2C with 3-card support, 
  opener has a 2D bid available to show this hand. But if you use 2D for 3-card 
  support, opener will have to rebid 2 of his suit with minimum <b><i>and </i></b>sub-minimum 
  hands. If responder has extra playing strength, he'll have to guess about 
  whether or not it's safe to bid on.</font></p>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><u><font size="2">Evaluating your hand</font></u></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A Drury 2C response is 
  encouraging, but it doesn't promise a strong game invitation. To use Drury, 
  you should have something better than just a maximum high-card-point single 
  raise, and you'll often have to come up with a descriptive rebid to pinpoint 
  your strength. Here are some examples of responding hands after partner opens 
  1H:</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>A843&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">K107&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">5&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">J10864</b> 
  -- Bid 2C. This is only 8 high-card points, but it evaluates to 10 support 
  points.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>963&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">Q102&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ84&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ4</b> 
  -- Bid 2C. This is a dead-minimum Drury bid, and you'll show it by making a 
  minimum rebid in hearts at your next turn (or by passing if partner rebids 
  2H).</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>3&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">Q874&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">A10954&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K43</b> 
  -- Bid 2C (or 2D if you play Two-Way Drury). This is a fairly strong Drury 
  hand, and you plan to bid 4H if partner's rebid shows he has a full opener. 
  But don't hang him for opening light -- if partner rebids 2H to show a 
  sub-minimum, you should pass.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>KJ3&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">842&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">Q754&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ4</b> 
  -- Bid 2H. This is a flat 9 pts. with poor trumps, so just make a simple 
  raise.</font></p>
  <hr width="100%">
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opener's Rebids</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opener's rebid over 2C shows 
  whether or not he has a &quot;full&quot; opening bid. A popular treatment 
  (called &quot;Reverse Drury&quot;) uses the rebid of his suit to show the bad 
  hand. Most other bids are natural and show at least a full opener. The 
  meanings are:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>2 of your major</b> (1S-2C-<b>2S</b>) 
      = bare minimum or sub-opener. The Drury bidder can now pass safely at the 
      2-level.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>2D</b> = a 
      &quot;normal&quot; opening bid, but with nothing extra (13 pts.) -- 
      usually a hand that would have passed a standard limit raise. The Drury 
      bidder can sign off at 2 with a minimum or jump to 3 (or 4) with a real 
      powerhouse.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>2H</b> (after 1S-2C) = Full 
      opener with 4 hearts. This allows you to find a 4-4 fit, which will often 
      play better than a 5-3.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Any other new suit</b> 
      (1H-2C-<strong>2S</strong>, or 1S-2C-<strong>3C</strong>) = Extra values, 
      showing a second suit and at least game-try values.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Double jump in a new 
      suit </strong>(1S-2C-<b>4C, 4D or 4H</b>) = Splinter, showing a slam try 
      with singleton in that suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>2NT</b> = A strong notrump 
      opener (15-17). If the Drury bidder is also balanced, 3NT may be a better 
      spot.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>3NT</b> = Balanced, 18+ 
      pts.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>4 of your major</b> = any 
      hand that wants to play game opposite 10 support pts. Opener will usually 
      choose this bid unless he wants to try for a slam.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><u><font size="2">Choosing your rebid</font></u></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You open 1S in third seat and 
  partner bids 2C (Drury). What is your rebid?</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>AQJ54&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">1032&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">J2&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K64</b> 
  -- Bid 2S to show a sub-minimum. Partner will almost always pass.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>KQJ73&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">4&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">102&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ1043</b> 
  -- Bid 4S. There's no point in bidding 3C, which will only serve to give the 
  opponents information.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>Q10975 
  &nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ7&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ84&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">3</b> 
  -- Bid 3D, which shows a game-try (or better) and will help partner evaluate 
  his hand. You have only 13 high-card pts., but if partner has fitting honors 
  in diamonds, you should have good chances to make 4S.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>AKQ84&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A94&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ105&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">4</b> 
  -- Bid 4C, a splinter showing a singleton club and slam interest. If partner 
  has his high-card strength outside clubs, he'll cooperate with a cuebid. If he 
  bids 4S, he probably has wasted club honors, and you'll pass.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>A10754&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ83&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">A10&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">74 
  -- </b>Bid 2H. This shows a full opener and a 4-card heart suit, but it 
  doesn't necessarily promise extra strength. If partner raises to 3H, you'll 
  bid 4H. If he retreats to 2S, he has a minimum (and probably wasn't encouraged 
  by your heart bid), and you can pass.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>K8543&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A62&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ3&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">54</b> 
  -- Bid 2D. This tells partner you have a full opener, but that you aren't 
  strong enough to accept a normal game invitation. If partner has maximum 
  playing strength, this provides some encouragement. If he has a balanced 
  minimum, he can retreat to 2S and you can pass.</font></p>
