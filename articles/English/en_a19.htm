  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some suit combinations allow you 
  to create extra tricks by capturing the opponent's honors. You can do this by 
  trying a <b><i>finesse</i></b> in a suit where you have one or more, but not 
  all, of the high honors. When you finesse, you play the suit as if a certain 
  opponent had one or more of the honors you're missing.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">To run a finesse, first try to 
  visualize where you need a missing honor to be. Then lead the suit<b><i> 
  through</i></b> the opponent you hope has the honor (arrange for him to be <b><i>second</i></b> 
  to play to the trick). Depending on which card he plays, choose a card from 
  the third hand (yours or dummy's) that isn't the highest card in the suit, but 
  which will win if second-hand has the honor you're trying to trap.</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Keep in mind that your 
      opponents will usually follow two defensive card-play rules:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Second-hand low</b> -- if 
        you lead a small card from your hand or dummy, the next hand to play to 
        the trick (your opponent) will play a low card from most holdings.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Cover an honor with an 
        honor</b> -- if you lead an honor from your hand or dummy, the next hand 
        to play to the trick will usually cover with a higher honor if he has 
        one.</font></li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If you have 8 or fewer 
        total cards in a suit</b>, you should finesse to trap the queen. A 
        missing queen will not usually drop if you cash ace-king.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If you have 9+ cards in a 
        suit</b>, you should usually play for the drop instead of finessing. 
        Since the defenders have only 4 cards in the suit, their queen is likely 
        to fall if you cash ace-king.<br>

        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If you have 10 or fewer 
        cards in a suit</b>, always try a finesse to trap a king. A king won't 
        usually fall under the ace unless you have an 11-card fit.<br>

          Cash dummy's ace, then lead the 2 towards your Q76. If RHO plays low,

          his king, you'll win the ace and lose only one trick to the jack. If 
          LHO plays low on your queen, play low from dummy. If RHO wins the 
          queen, you'll finesse LHO for the jack by leading the 10 towards the

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><i>Note</i></b>:&nbsp; For 
  simplicity, all of the above examples show combinations where you and dummy 
  have equal length in the suit.&nbsp; Most of the recommendations still apply 
  if you have unequal suit lengths and/or if the &quot;spot&quot; cards are in 
  different hands.&nbsp; For example, in the last combination above (A432 
  opposite Q1098),&nbsp; you would try the same double finesse if the cards were 
  A43 opposite Q10982, or A983 opposite Q104, or even A102 opposite Q93.</font>
