    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Some suit combinations allow you
        to create extra tricks by capturing the opponent's honors. You can do this by
        trying a <b><i>finesse</i></b> in a suit where you have one or more, but not
        all, of the high honors. When you finesse, you play the suit as if a certain
        opponent had one or more of the honors you're missing.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">To run a finesse, first try to
        visualize where you need a missing honor to be. Then lead the suit<b><i>
            through</i></b> the opponent you hope has the honor (arrange for him to be <b><i>second</i></b>
        to play to the trick). Depending on which card he plays, choose a card from
        the third hand (yours or dummy's) that isn't the highest card in the suit, but
        which will win if second-hand has the honor you're trying to trap.</font>

                you lead a small card from your hand or dummy, the next hand to play to
                the trick (your opponent) will play a low card from most holdings.</font>
