        When you and partner are searching for a trump suit, your first goal is to
        find an 8-card or longer fit in a major. In some auctions, you'll discover
        this fit immediately, such as when partner opens 1H or 1S and you hold 3+
        cards in his suit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In other auctions -- usually those
        that start with an opening bid of 1C or 1D -- it may take two rounds of
        bidding before you determine whether or not you have a major-suit fit. In
        these auctions, it's important that you and partner have a logical, controlled
        way to exchange information about your suit lengths. Here are the standard
        ways to discover your 8+-card major-suit fits.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">When you're 4-4 or 4-4-4</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If partner opens and you have two
        or three 4-card suits you could bid at the one-level, you should respond your
        cheapest suit (or, with a weak hand, your <b><i>cheaper major</i></b>). This
        practice is called &quot;up-the-line&quot;, and opener also follows it with
        his rebids. After you respond, if opener has a 4-card suit he can show at the
        one-level, he'll always bid it. If he has two 4-card suits, he'll bid the
        cheaper one.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This practice conserves space and
        assures that you'll always find a 4-4 major-suit fit if you have one. Here's
        an example:</font>
    <pre
      style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Partner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Partner opens 1C. Even though your
        spades are stronger, the correct response with your hand is 1H (the cheaper of
        your 4-card suits). With the hand above, partner will raise to 2H, you'll
        pass, and you'll probably make an overtrick.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Look what happens if you violate
        the &quot;up-the-line&quot; practice and respond 1S with the hand above.
        Opener will assume that since you bypassed a 1H bid, you don't hold 4 hearts,
        so he'll rebid 1NT to show his minimum opener and keep the bidding low. Your
        hand isn't strong enough to risk going to the 2-level in a new suit, so you'll
        have to pass, and you've missed your 8-card heart fit. Your 1NT contract will
        go down if an opponent has 5 or more diamonds.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Now change partner's hand by
        moving two of the small hearts to spades, giving him&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"

        </b>With this hand, he won't raise hearts, but he has room to bid 1S to show a
        4-card suit, which you'll raise to 2S. By responding your cheaper major,
        you've left room to find a possible fit in <b><i>either</i></b> major.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Note that there are three more
        basic tenets of bridge bidding that opener and responder are following here:<br>
        <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; New suits at the one-level are forcing.</b>
        With rare exceptions, after an opening and a response, neither of you should
        pass until you've reached a contract of 1NT or 2 of a suit.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>2)&nbsp; If you hold a balanced minimum , don't
          bid past 1NT unless you know you have a trump fit. </b>This rule applies to
        opener (whose minimum is 13-15 pts.) <b><i>and</i></b> responder (6-9 pts.).
        In general, when you have a weak hand with only 4-card suits, the only time
        you should go to the 2-level is when you're raising partner's suit to confirm
        an 8+-card fit.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>3)&nbsp; If partner bypasses a suit he could have
          bid at the one-level, you should assume he does <i>not</i> have 4-card length
          in it.</b> The only time you should ever bid a suit partner has denied is when
        you have significant extra values and want to force the auction higher (see
        the lesson on <font color="#0000FF">The Reverse</font>).
      </font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Bypassing diamonds</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Many pairs apply the
        &quot;up-the-line&quot; principle only to majors, and they will bypass a
        4-card diamond suit -- or even a 5-carder -- to show their cheaper major. The
        weaker your hand, the more anxious you should be to follow this guideline.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">For example, suppose partner opens
        1C and you hold&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13"
          height="11"><b>J42&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13"

            height="11">KJ93&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">74</b>.
        You're weak and may have only one chance to describe your hand, so show your
        major right away with a 1H response. If you follow the &quot;up-the-line&quot;
        principle religiously and instead bid 1D, you can still find a possible 4-4
        heart fit, but only if partner gets the chance to bid 1H. The risk is that
        your left-hand-opponent will overcall 1S, and partner won't have a strong
        enough hand to bid a new suit at the 2-level.</font>

    <hr align="left">
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">When you're 5-4The up-the-line
        rule applies only when you have <b><i>4-card</i></b> suits of equal length.&nbsp;
        If you have suits of unequal length, you should still show your longer one
        first.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If your 5-card suit is lower in
        rank than your 4-carder, you won't have to bid both of them. If partner opens

        </b>. If partner now rebids 1NT, you won't have to worry about showing your
        spades because you know you don't have a fit there -- since partner bypassed a
        1S bid, you should assume that he does <b><i>not</i></b> hold 4 spades. Over
        1NT, you would bid 2H and partner will pass.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If your 5-card suit is <b><i>higher</i></b>
        in rank than your 4-card suit, there will be many auctions where you'll want
        to bid both suits. If partner opens 1D, you would respond 1S with&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" border="0"
          NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11"><b>J10942&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" border="0"

        This will imply that you don't have 4 hearts, but if partner rebids 1NT, you
        plan to show your heart suit by bidding 2H. Partner will know you had a good
        reason for skipping hearts with your first response, and that reason has to be
        that your spades are longer. This specific auction is not forcing and asks
        partner to choose between your two suits, either by passing (if he prefers
        hearts) or by bidding 2S. Going to the 2-level is safe here because partner's
        1NT rebid promises at least 2-3 cards in every suit, so you know you have a
        fair fit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The meaning of a 2H rebid is
        different, though, if partner does <b><i>not</i></b> rebid 1NT. Suppose
        partner opens 1D, you bid 1S, and he rebids 2C or 2D. In these cases, partner
        hasn't promised any length in either of your suits, so you have no guarantee
        of a fit. In non-fitting auctions like this, a new-suit bid by you would
        therefore be forcing. If partner rebids 2D, he has a minimum opener with 6+
        diamonds, and you should pass with the hand above. If his rebid is 2C, he's
        asking you to choose between his two suits, and you should just retreat to 2D.
        Since partner is showing at least 9 cards in the minors, it's very unlikely
        that you're missing a good major-suit fit.&nbsp;</font>

    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">When you're 5-5</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">A different principle operates
        when you have two <b><i>5-card</i></b> suits.&nbsp; In this case, you should <b>respond
          the higher-ranking suit first</b>, then bid the lower-ranking one.With two
        long suits, you'll often want to force partner to choose one, so it's
        important to plan your bids so you can leave partner with maximum bidding
        space on the <b><i>second</i></b> round of the auction.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">

            height="11">J&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">43</b>,
        you should respond 1S (the higher-ranking suit). If partner rebids 1NT, you'll
        bid 2H, which is non-forcing and lets him choose between your suits at the
        2-level. If you instead responded 1H on the first round, you would have to bid
        2S at your next turn. If partner preferred hearts, he'd have to go up to the
        3-level to take you back to that suit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If you have a weak hand and
        partner does <b><i>not</i></b> rebid 1NT, you'll have to give up on showing
        both of your suits. With the hand above, after 1D by partner--1S by you--2D by
        partner, you should pass. A 2H rebid by you would be forcing here, and your
        hand is too weak to risk taking this non-fitting auction any higher.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This approach works well with
        stronger hands, too.&nbsp; For example, if partner opens 1C, you would bid 1S
        with<br>
        <img src="s.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11"><b>AK1084&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;<img src="h.gif"
          border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11"><b>KJ872&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" border="0"

            width="13" height="11">4.&nbsp;</b>
        Over partner's 1NT rebid, you would now <b><i>jump</i></b> to 3H (because, as
        noted above, 2H would <b><i>not</i></b> be forcing here). If partner has
        3-card spade support, he'll bid 3S over your 3H. If he has 4 hearts, he'll
        raise to 4H. If he has neither of these holdings, he'll rebid 3NT and you can
        now complete the picture of your hand by bidding 4H.<br>
