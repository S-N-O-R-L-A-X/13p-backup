  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Have you ever heard (or 
  participated in) a discussion like this after a &quot;creative&quot; double 
  had backfired?</font>

    <b>WEST:</b> So can I pass it, or can't I?</font>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Just a few decades or so ago, 
  bridge players seldom had this type of misunderstanding. Back then, there were 
  only a few well-defined situations where a double was takeout, and almost all 
  other doubles were &quot;for business&quot;.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In recent years, competitive 
  bidding has become much more lively, and players have developed new meanings 
  for many old-fashioned penalty doubles. Some modern doubles -- including 
  negative, responsive, support and maximal -- are conventional and apply only 
  in clearly defined situations. Others -- including those called cooperative, 
  two-way, re-takeout, action, informative -- aren't as easy to define because 
  they are often used in more complicated auctions.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">These modern doubles make 
  competitive bidding more flexible and accurate, but they also create more 
  opportunities for misunderstandings, even for established partnerships. There 
  are so many uses for the double now that it's virtually impossible to discuss 
  every situation that might come up at the table. Instead, many players develop 
  general &quot;default&quot; agreements that can apply to a wide range of 
  auctions.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The modern practice seems to be 
  &quot;when in doubt, it's takeout&quot;. If you follow this general approach, 
  it's easier to define your penalty doubles than to discuss all the auctions 
  where a double is something else. You can start with this list, which 
  summarizes some &quot;universal&quot; default agreements. These are basic 
  situations where (barring a convention or partnership agreement to the 
  contrary) most players assume that the doubler's <b><i>intention</i></b> is 
  penalty:</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2"><u>Default</u>: It's a penalty 
  double if:</font></b></h3>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">1. We double a natural notrump 
  call.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Direct doubles of 1NT opening bids 
  and overcalls tend to be &quot;pure&quot; penalty, and the doubler's partner 
  usually passes. This also applies to balancing notrumps and notrump bids after 
  any takeout double (ours or theirs). Defining exactly what constitutes a 
  &quot;natural&quot; notrump call in other situations, however, is a subject 
  for your default agreements. We'll discuss these doubles in the next article.</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">2. Either of us has bid a natural 
  notrump earlier in the auction.</font></h4>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">3. Either of us has made an 
  earlier penalty double (or a penalty pass of a takeout double).</font></h4>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">4. Either of us has made a 
  card-showing double or redouble earlier.</font></h4>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">5. Either of us has preempted.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This includes doubles made after 
  we open make a preemptive opening bid, a weak jump overcall, a weak jump shift 
  or a preemptive raise. The doubler will usually be the preempter's partner, 
  although the weak hand may be the one making a penalty double if his partner 
  has shown strength.</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">6. Either of us has made an 
  earlier lead-directing double of an artificial bid.</font></h4>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">7. There are NO unbid suits.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This includes auctions in which 
  all four suits haven't been directly bid, but have been shown or implied, as 
  in:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Partner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;</u>
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2NT *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3H&nbsp;&nbsp;* (Unusual for minors)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>(<i>or</i> Pass, Pass, <i>DBL</i>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>or</i> Pass, Pass, <i>DBL</i>)</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This definition of a penalty 
  double is often extended to include auctions where there's just <b><i>one</i></b> 
  unbid suit. There are so many exceptions to this, though, that it doesn't 
  really qualify as a blanket agreement.</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">8. We've already found our fit.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One of the most common situations 
  is when an opponent overcalls or balances after you've made a simple raise:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Partner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO</u>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3C
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<i>or</i> Pass, Pass, DBL)</font></pre>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">9. It's made late in the auction.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">There's no question that a double 
  is for penalty after the opponents bid 1S-2S-4S, but other high-level doubles 
  can lead to misunderstandings. Depending on the auction and your agreements 
  (or lack of them), a double may suggest more than just a trump stack. Does it 
  direct a lead? Is it pure penalty if one of us has bid earlier? And how late 
  is &quot;late&quot;? These are questions for your default agreements.</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">10. The doubler's partner has 
  accurately described his strength and distribution.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This one is a little harder to 
  pinpoint, and tends to fall into the &quot;when-in-doubt&quot; category. It's 
  a broad principle that encompasses many of the situations above. It can also 
  apply in auctions where we've each had an earlier opportunity to make a 
  constructive call, such as:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Partner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;</u>
(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; 1C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp; (or Pass, Pass, <i>DBL</i>)

(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; 1D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp; (or Pass, Pass, <i>DBL</i>)</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This by no means a comprehensive 
  list. There are other situations where a double can be for penalty, and modern 
  bidding has developed some almost-standard exceptions to some of these old 
  rules. The definitions above, however, can serve as a starting point for 
  discussions with your regular partner, or as a fall-back set of agreements 
  with a new partner.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In upcoming articles, we'll 
  discuss some popular modifications to these guidelines and recommend simple 
  default agreements you can use to cover ambiguous doubles.</font>
  <hr>
  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Default Agreements: </b>Was 
  that a penalty double ?</font></h2>

  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">What type of hand do you expect 
  your partner to have for his double in this auction?</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;</u>

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Does he have a hand that was too 
  short in hearts -- or too weak in high-cards -- to make a first-round takeout 
  double? Or is this a penalty double?</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In the last article, we listed ten 
  standard situations where, absent a convention or other existing agreement, a 
  double is for penalty. The first one was:</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><u>Default #1</u>: It's penalty 
  if we double a natural notrump call.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The most common situations are 
  direct doubles of 1NT openings and overcalls, which are seldom misunderstood. 
  Doubles in other auctions, however, may be misinterpreted if you don't have a 
  general agreement to cover them.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One example is the auction above, 
  which causes trouble for many pairs. Is the double still penalty if it's a 1NT 
  <b><i>rebid</i></b>? If the doubler is a passed hand? There's also the problem 
  of deciding exactly what constitutes a &quot;natural&quot; notrump bid.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here's a basic set of agreements 
  you can use to sort out your doubles of notrump bids. These are &quot;modern 
  standard&quot; interpretations -- the meanings I would assume if these doubles 
  came up in a new partnership with an experienced player. Also included are 
  some popular treatments you may want to discuss with your regular partner.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When the opponents overcall 1NT:</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If we open the bidding and an 
  opponent bids notrump, the general default is that a double by either of us is 
  penalty. Depending on the situation, some of these doubles virtually command 
  partner to pass; others are just strong suggestions.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The one that's closest to being a 
  command is when you double a direct 1NT overcall of your partner's opening 
  suit bid. You expect partner to pass, although he may pull with a very unusual 
  hand.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If it's opener who doubles 1NT, 
  (as in 1C-1NT-Pass-P / <b><i>DBL</i></b>), it shows 18+ points, whether it's a 
  direct or balancing 1NT. In either case, his partner will often pass, but can 
  pull if he has a very weak hand with a long suit or length in opener's suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>What if it's an 
  &quot;unnatural&quot; 1NT?</b> If your opponent makes a &quot;sandwich&quot; 
  1NT overcall (1C-Pass-1H-<b><i>1NT</i></b> to show a weak two-suiter), you may 
  want to adopt a different meaning for a double. We'll discuss doubles of 
  artificial bids in an future article.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When the opponents open 1NT:</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some players like to double 1NT 
  with almost any hand that has at least the same strength as opener. This is a 
  poor strategy. Since your partner may have a super-weak hand with nowhere to 
  go, it's much wiser to promise a <b><i>better </i></b>hand than opener.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Essentially, this means that the 
  higher your opponent's notrump range, the greater your intention to penalize 
  -- and the more likely partner is to pass. Partner won't usually pull a double 
  of a strong 1NT unless he has a very weak hand with a long suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When doubling a strong 1NT, one of 
  your most important considerations is having a strong (or at least safe) suit 
  to lead. You'd be happy to double 1NT with&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AK&nbsp; 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">1092&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KQJ1076&nbsp; 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K7 . That hand is only 16 
  points, but it rates to take more tricks than an 18-count like&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ2&nbsp; 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ5&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ643&nbsp; 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ, which you should pass.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If it seems like these strict 
  requirements mean you'll seldom be making penalty doubles of strong notrumps, 
  you're right. That's why many popular conventions use the double to show a 
  one-suited hand.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Doubles of weak notrumps (ranges 
  of 10-12 and up) should promise a little more than the top of the opponent's 
  range. A double of a 10-12 notrump, for example, should promise at least a 
  good 13-count. These doubles still suggest penalizing 1NT, but partner will 
  pull them more often than doubles of strong notrumps.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your strategy should change 
  somewhat in the pass-out seat, so you may want to lighten up these doubles at 
  some vulnerabilities. If you're white vs. red, it can be valuable to play that 
  a balancing double (1NT-Pass-Pass-<b><i>DBL</i></b>) promises only 11-12+ 
  points. This can net you a large penalty when partner has 9-10 points and 
  passes. Even if he's weak and has to pull, you'll often have a safe spot at 
  the 2-level.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When the opponents rebid or 
  respond 1NT:</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your general default -- doubles of 
  natural notrumps are penalty -- also applies in longer auctions where you or 
  the opponents start with a suit overcall or takeout double. If either opponent 
  responds or rebids a natural notrump later, your double is still penalty.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One example is when an opponent 
  responds 1NT after your side makes a takeout double. In the auction 
  1H-DBL-1NT-<b><i>DBL</i></b>, the last double is pure penalty, and partner 
  will almost always pass. The double becomes more optional if it's made by the 
  takeout doubler (as in 1H-DBL-1NT-P / Pass-<b><i>DBL</i></b>). He shows 17+ 
  pts. and suggests penalizing 1NT, but partner is free to pull if he has a very 
  weak hand with a long unbid suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A trickier situation is a <b><i>delayed 
  </i></b>double of a 1NT response or rebid. This is the problem at the 
  beginning of this article. Some pairs play this double as takeout (see below), 
  but if you have no agreement, you apply your default, which means it would be 
  penalty. It shows a trap-pass with length in the suit bid on the doubler's 
  right, so it also suggests a lead. In the example auction, partner -- who 
  might hold&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">K7&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A105&nbsp; 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K76&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ1086 
  -- wants you to pass. If you were on lead, you would lead a club.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When is a double of 1NT for 
  takeout?</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The value of this default is that 
  it can be applied to so many auctions, but there are some important 
  exceptions. One is a direct double of a 1NT response (1H-Pass-1NT-<b><i>DBL</i></b>), 
  which is best played as takeout of opener's suit. This double promises a good 
  hand, but it's not intended as penalty. Your default agreements should define 
  1NT responses (both the standard and forcing varieties) as <b><i>non-</i></b>natural 
  notrumps.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can also make an exception for 
  the delayed double in the auction at the beginning of this article. If you 
  prefer to play this as takeout, it would show a decent hand that had the wrong 
  distribution for a first-round double. The obvious reason is that the doubler 
  was short in the suit bid on his left. In the auction at the beginning of the 
  article, partner might hold<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">K1075&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">84&nbsp; 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AK54&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K93.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Whether you choose to play the 
  delayed double of 1NT as penalty or takeout, note that it always implies a 
  good hand and at least moderate length in the suit bid on the doubler's right. 
  This means that if you double and partner bids opener's suit (1C-Pass-1H-Pass 
  / 1NT-DBL-Pass-<b>2C</b>), it's not a cuebid -- he wants to play there.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You should also keep the penalty 
  meaning if the delayed double is made under any other conditions -- after a 
  longer auction (for example, if the opponents bid 1C-1H-1S-1NT) or in the 
  pass-out seat. In the auction we started with, suppose partner had passed 1NT 
  and <b><i>you</i></b> had doubled (1C-Pass-1H-Pass / 1NT-Pass-Pass-<b>DBL</b>). 
  It doesn't make much sense to play this as takeout, since you could have shown 
  the other two suits by doubling on the last round. Instead, it should promise 
  a good hand with heart length and strength.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Another common use of the penalty 
  double is in auctions where your side bids notrump. In the next article, we'll 
  discuss standard treatments for these doubles and some popular 
  &quot;expert&quot; default agreements you can use to compete more effectively.</font>

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Does your partnership have clear 
  agreements about the meanings of these doubles?</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u> Partner&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In the first article in this 
  series, we listed ten standard situations where, absent a special agreement to 
  the contrary, a double is for penalty. The second one was:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Default #2: </b>It's a 
    penalty double if either of us has bid a natural notrump earlier in the 
    auction.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The advantage of this agreement is 
  its simplicity. It applies to any double in any auction where you've opened, 
  responded or rebid a natural notrump. If you follow it explicitly, all the 
  doubles above would be penalty.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">However, if this 
  always-for-penalty agreement seems inflexible to you, you have lots of 
  company. Many pairs who follow this general default make exceptions for some 
  doubles. A few of these treatments are so popular among experienced players 
  that they might be called &quot;expert standard&quot;.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One common situation is when you 
  open 1NT and an opponent makes a 2-level overcall (Auctions #1 and #2 above). 
  To improve your use of doubles here, you might want to start with this 
  all-purpose default agreement, which can actually be used to interpret 
  ambiguous doubles in almost any type of auction:</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Default:</u> </b>When in 
  doubt, if the double is <b><i>over</i></b> the bidder, it's penalty. If it's <b><i>under 
  </i></b>the bidder, it's takeout.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This is based on the idea that 
  you're most likely to want to penalize an overcall when your trumps are 
  sitting over the long suit. Onside penalty doubles are less attractive, so 
  this agreement gives you a way to compete when you have shortness in the 
  overcalled suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you apply this default to 
  Auction #1 above, opener's double is clearly penalty because the overcall was 
  on his right (his trumps are over the bidder). He should have a maximum with 
  strong trumps:<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">A6&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ106&nbsp; 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ93&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">J102.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In Auction #2, opener's double is 
  takeout because the overcall was on his left. His double shows shortness in 
  the opponent's suit (best is a weak doubleton) and good support for the other 
  three suits. In most cases, he'll also have more than a minimum -- a hand 
  like:&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AK86&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">62&nbsp; 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ103&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">A108. 
  This extra strength adds some safety if you have trump length and want to pass 
  the double.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The same default applies to 
  responder's doubles. In Auction #1, if opener had passed 2H and you had 
  doubled in the pass-out seat, it would be takeout because you're under the 
  bidder. You might hold&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">Q1054&nbsp; 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">62&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ8&nbsp; 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">10975. In Auction #2, if you 
  had doubled the direct 2H overcall, it would be penalty.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some pairs have the additional 
  agreement that if responder uses the takeout double, he promises at least a 
  doubleton in the overcalled suit. The advantage is that opener can make a 
  better decision about whether to bid or pass for penalty. The downside is that 
  you won't be able to double when you have a singleton in their suit, which is 
  the hand most suitable for takeout.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After conventional overcalls:</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Natural overcalls over 1NT openers 
  are rare these days, so you need to be ready for artificial and two-suited 
  bids. Some of these conventions add an extra round to the auction, but your 
  default still applies: a double over the hand that <b><i>showed the suit</i></b> 
  (even if his partner becomes declarer) is penalty; a double under that hand is 
  takeout.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here's how your default agreement 
  works if partner opens 1NT and your RHO makes a conventional overcall:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Over 2C </b>(unspecified 
      one-suiter) -- use double as Stayman. If you pass first and then double 
      RHO's runout, it's penalty since you're over the bidder. If you pass and <b><i>partner</i></b> 
      doubles the runout, it's takeout.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Over a double </b>(unspecified 
      one-suiter) -- play &quot;system-on&quot; (2C Stayman, transfers, etc.). 
      Redouble shows invitational-or-better strength and suggests you might want 
      to penalize the runout. If you pass first and then double the runout, it's 
      still penalty, but implies a hand weaker in high-card points.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Over a two-suited overcall 
      that names one of the suit </b>(2C for clubs and another suit, or 2S for 
      spades and a minor) -- double is penalty of the bid suit. If you pass and <b><i>partner</i></b> 
      doubles that suit <b><i>or</i></b> the overcaller's second suit, it's 
      takeout.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Over an artificial 
      two-suited overcall </b>(2C or 2D for the majors) -- double shows 
      invitational-or-better strength and suggests you have a penalty double of 
      one or both of the overcaller's suits.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After three-level overcalls:</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you have a decent responding 
  hand, Auction #3 above is a tougher problem. The jump overcall has taken away 
  most of your bidding tools, including Stayman, transfers and Lebensohl. And 
  since the overcaller has a very long suit, you usually don't rate to get rich 
  by doubling.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This is why some pairs use 3-level 
  negative doubles in their notrump systems. If the overcall is 2NT or 3 of a 
  suit, responder's double is similar to Stayman. It shows forcing-to-game 
  values and asks opener to bid 4-card suits up the line. Direct doubles of 
  2-level overcalls are still penalty, since they allow you room to use other 
  bids to check for majors and stoppers.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Negative doubles are a great 
  solution when you have a game-going hand with a major, but they take away the 
  direct penalty double. If you have a &quot;real&quot; penalty double, you'll 
  have to pass and hope partner can re-open with a takeout double.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After notrump rebids and 
  responses:</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Another use of the penalty double 
  comes after your side opens a suit and responds or rebids 1NT. This includes 
  simple auctions like 1D by you - 1NT by partner - 2C by RHO - <b>DBL</b> by 
  you. Your general default defines all your doubles in these auctions as 
  penalty, and that's a good agreement to keep for most situations.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">An exception you might want to 
  consider is for opener's direct double after his partner responds a forcing 
  1NT, as in Auction #4 above. One approach is to use this double to show extra 
  values and <b><i>shortness</i></b> (two or fewer cards) in the overcalled 
  suit. This solves opener's problem when he holds a hand like&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AK863&nbsp; 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ8&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">6&nbsp; 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ65, which would be hard to 
  describe otherwise. If opener instead bids a new suit over the overcall, it 
  promises a &quot;real&quot; 5-card suit and denies extra values.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some pairs add the requirement 
  that opener's double promises at least a doubleton in the opponent's suit. 
  This makes it easier for responder to pass for penalty, but it limits opener's 
  options when he holds a singleton, as in the hand above.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Whichever approach you choose for 
  Auction #4, you should follow your general default in all other auctions where 
  you rebid or respond notrump. A double is still penalty if the opening bid was 
  a minor or if it's made by the 1NT bidder.<br>
