      <font size="4">Opening Leads: When to be
        aggressive</font>
    </h2>
    <hr width="100%">
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Some opening leads are relatively
        easy. If you're on lead after the opponents bid 1NT-3NT, for example, the old
        guideline of &quot;fourth down from your longest and strongest suit&quot;
        works well on most hands. You also have an easy lead if partner has overcalled
        a suit, or when you have a suit with a strong honor holding (KQJ, QJ10, AK,
        etc.).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">On many hands, though, your choice
        won't be as clear, and that's why opening leads are one of the most difficult
        parts of the game. Making a good one requires require careful analysis of the
        auction. On some difficult hands, you'll want to make a passive, safe opening
        lead that isn't likely to give away a trick -- such as a lead from a
        &quot;topless&quot; suit like 87643 or 10982. On other hands, it will pay to
        make an aggressive lead, such as an underlead of an unprotected honor.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">How do you know when an aggressive
        lead is the best choice? One of your strongest clues comes when the opponents
        have an auction that identifies a long, strong side suit that can be set up as
        a source of tricks. For example, suppose you're North holding:<br>
        <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>A5&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13"
            height="11">743&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ953&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13"
            height="11">Q72</b><br>
        and it's your lead after your opponents have the following auction:
      </font>
    <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>West&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East
</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2H&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4S</font></pre>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Your best opening lead is probably
        the 5 of diamonds (fourth best). You hope partner has either the ace or queen
        of diamonds, but even if he doesn't, your risky lead may not cost anything.
        Dummy has shown a long (and probably strong) heart suit that may be used to
        pitch declarer's losers. It's important to set up possible tricks for your
        side right now, while you still have the trump ace as an entry to cash them.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>How about leads to higher-level
          contracts? </b>When the opponents bid a small slam, your natural instinct may
        be to make a safe opening lead, but on some hands, being passive can give away
        the contract. An aggressive lead is often your only chance to beat a slam,
        especially if the opponents have shown great strength and/or a side fit. For
        example, suppose your opponents bid to 6H via this auction:</font>
    <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b> <u>West&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East
</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; 2D
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; 4NT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5H&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6H</font></pre>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">And you're on lead with&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>109874&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13"
            height="11">762&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">A3&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13"
            height="11">K102</b>.
      </font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The spade 10 looks safe, but it
        doesn't rate to set up a trick for your side. That would require partner to
        have the spade king and dummy to have the ace (or partner to have KJ and dummy
        the queen), <b><i>and</i></b> declarer and dummy to each have at least two
        spades. It's better to set your sights lower and play partner for the club
        queen. Lead the club 2 and hope you can set up and cash a club when you get in
        with the diamond ace.&nbsp; If it happens that you've led into declarer's AQ
        of clubs, you may have lost nothing, since it's likely that his potential club
        losers would have been pitched on dummy's diamonds.</font>
