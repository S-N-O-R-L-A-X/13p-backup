  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="4">Matchpoint (Pairs) Strategy at 
  Duplicate Bridge</font></b></h2>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>The Bidding</u></b>:</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Bid aggressively. </b>Duplicate 
  pairs tend to bid &quot;close&quot; games and slams, so don't settle for a 
  safe partscore if you think there's a fair chance you can make game.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Choose the highest-scoring 
  game.</b> For game contracts, you should be most anxious to play 4H or 4S, 
  willing to play 3NT and reluctant to play 5C or 5D. If you have game values 
  and a club or diamond fit, consider playing 3NT instead.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Choose the safest partscore.</b> 
  When you have minimum high-card strength, choose the safety of a trump suit. A 
  major-suit is still best, but if you're deciding between notrump and a minor, 
  play a suit contract if you have a fit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Overcall freely.</b> Don't be 
  afraid to make light, lead-directing overcalls at the one-level -- especially 
  when you're not vulnerable and your opponent opens 1C or 1D. If you have to go 
  to the two-level to bid your suit, though, be somewhat cautious. For a 2-level 
  overcall, you should have a good suit (a strong 5-carder or, better, a 6+-card 
  suit), especially if you're vulnerable.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Raise partner's suit freely.</b> 
  Even if you're light in high-card points, stretch to raise partner if you have 
  a fit for his suit, especially in competitive auctions.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Sacrifice more often.</b> If 
  you have a good fit, sacrifice freely if your opponents are vulnerable and you 
  are not. But be <b><i>very</i></b> conservative when you're vulnerable.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Don't &quot;sell out&quot; too 
  low. </b>If the opponents stop at a low level, you don't have to have a strong 
  hand to balance back in. The best time to compete is when: (1) You're not 
  vulnerable; (2) The opponents have stopped in 1 or 2 of a suit contract (not 
  1NT or 2NT); and (3) You're short in the opponent's trump suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Double more partscores. </b>If 
  you bid to a partscore you think you could have made, but your opponents bid 
  over it, a double is sometimes necessary for you to get even an average score. 
  (Be very careful in choosing when to use this tip!)</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Use a simplified form of the 
  &quot;Law of Total Tricks (Trumps)&quot; for competitive decisions.</b> In 
  part-score situations -- those where you've found a fit but wanted to stop at 
  a low level -- don't let the opponents push you to the 3-level unless you have 
  a 9-card trump fit.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>The Play</u></b>:</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Make &quot;normal&quot; opening 
  leads. </b>Don't try for a &quot;top&quot; by choosing an unusual lead. 
  Against most contracts, choose a safe, non-deceptive opening lead.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Look for overtricks. </b>Unlike 
  in rubber bridge, it's sometimes right to make a fairly risky play trying for 
  the overtrick -- especially when you're in a &quot;normal&quot; contract that 
  you think will be bid by other pairs.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Play it safe if you're in an 
  unusual contract. </b>Go for the sure plus score if you're playing or 
  defending a contract that won't be bid at most tables.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>In General</u></b>:</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Play with the 
  &quot;field&quot;. </b>When in doubt about what to bid or play, try to guess 
  what might be happening at other tables and go for a similar result.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Consider using 15-17 pts. as 
  the range for your opening 1NT bids. </b>You'll often have a bidding advantage 
  when you open 1NT. Most duplicate players use the 15-17 range (rather than 
  16-18) because it allows them to open more hands with 1NT. If you use this 
  range, responder will need to adjust his requirements up by 1 pt. You should 
  also change your 2NT opening range to 20-22 pts.</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Consider adding popular 
      conventions to your system.</b> Because many duplicate pairs play the 
      conventions and treatments listed below, you might want to try them, too.
