  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><strong><u><font size="2">The Bidding:</font></u></strong></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Games:</strong> Bid the <i><b>safest</b></i> 
  game. At matchpoints, you may get a markedly better score for playing in 
  notrump instead of a major, or in a major instead of a minor. IMP scoring, 
  however, neutralizes the differences between these contracts. Your best 
  strategy is to choose your best (longest) trump fit and bid the game that's 
  most likely to make -- even if it's 5C instead of 3NT.</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If you're not vulnerable</b>, 
      don't stretch too far to bid a close game -- the odds favor bidding only 
      those games that you are reasonably sure will make.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If you're vulnerable,</b> 
      it pays to be a little more optimistic when you're considering a thin 
      game. The IMP odds (your potential gain if the contract makes) favor 
      bidding any game that has even a 40% chance of making.<br>
      </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Part scores: </strong>Look 
  for the <i><b>safest</b></i> part score. Don't worry about searching for a few 
  extra points by playing in notrump instead of a minor.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Overcalls: </strong>Matchpoint 
  players often make light overcalls, but it pays to beef up your overcalls at 
  IMPs. If you're vulnerable -- or if your overcall is at the 2-level -- you 
  should promise a strong suit and the playing strength of a full opening bid.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Competing and balancing: </strong>Don't 
  be too bold. Unless you have a good suit and good hand, let the opponents play 
  in their low-level contracts, especially if you're vulnerable. Trump length is 
  more important than overall strength, so don't let the opponents push you to 
  the 3-level unless you have a 9-card trump fit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Doubles: </strong>There's 
  little to gain -- and much to lose -- by making a penalty double of a close 
  contract, especially a part score. Don't make a penalty double unless you're 
  reasonably sure the contract is going down <i><b>at least two tricks</b></i>. 
  If the opponents sacrifice against your game and you are in doubt about 
  whether to bid higher, double and take your sure plus score.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Sacrifices:</strong> If 
  you want to take a non-vulnerable sacrifice over your opponent's vulnerable 
  game, you should be reasonably sure that you won't go down more than two 
  tricks. If you're vulnerable, you should be virtually certain that you won't 
  go down more than one trick. Anything more is &quot;too close for 
  comfort&quot; at IMP play, and won't gain you many IMPs. When in doubt, let 
  the opponents play the contract and hope you can beat it.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><strong><u><font size="2">The Play:</font></u></strong></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Overtricks:</strong> When 
  you're declarer, don't risk your contract trying to make an overtrick. Always 
  choose the safest line of play to make your contract, even if it might cost 
  you an overtrick or two.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Opening leads:</strong> Be 
  cautious about trying for a swing with an unusual opening lead. In the long 
  run, it's usually best to make your &quot;normal&quot; lead -- the same one 
  you think your opponent will make when the board is played at your team-mates' 
  table. Save your brilliant defensive plays for later in the hand, when you 
  have more information.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Defense:</strong> Be 
  optimistic and fairly aggressive when defending the opponents' contracts. If 
  there's a layout of the cards that will result in a set, choose your leads and 
  plays to cater to that possibility, even if it means you may give up an 
  overtrick if you're wrong.<br>
