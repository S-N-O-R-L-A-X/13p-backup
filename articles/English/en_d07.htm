  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Each of us recalls one special 
  hand, a deal where we were unusually clever.<br>
  You may have played yours years ago, but you'll remember it forever.<br>
  Perhaps you made a daring bid, or dropped an offsides king.<br>
  It's in your memory as &quot;Best Bid&quot;, &quot;Best Played&quot;, or maybe 
  . . . &quot;Most Embarrassing&quot;.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The latter is the reason that I 
  remember mine.<br>
  It was dealt at the Summer Nationals, in Las Vegas in '79.<br>
  We were playing in the Master Pairs. It was the last round of the session.<br>
  My partner was &quot;The Grape&quot;, a name earned by his sour expression.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">We were rolling along at a few 
  boards over, but I knew we couldn't stop.<br>
  We needed to end with two good scores to ensure our section top.<br>
  Our final opponents seated themselves, and much to my delight,<br>
  An 80-year-old lady was on my left, and her mother was on my right.</font>

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">I made a bad lead on first board,   
  and their partscore easily made.&nbsp;<br>  
  Then Board #25:&nbsp;<br>  
  Partner dealt and passed, and Mother bid &quot;One Spade&quot;.&nbsp;</font>  
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">I sorted my hand and saw the   
  chance to get a good board back.&nbsp;<br>  
  Three little spades, two minor-suit stiffs, eight hearts to the Ace-King-Jack.&nbsp;<br>  
  To bid Four Hearts was obvious, but that seemed too mundane.&nbsp;<br>  
  I'd have to be much more clever to talk them out of their game.&nbsp;</font>  
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&quot;One Notrump,&quot; I bid in   
  tempo, repeating it twice for Mother.&nbsp;<br>  
  But then Daughter made the only bid from which I'd never recover.&nbsp;<br>  
  &quot;Two Hearts,&quot; she bid on her twelve-count. Could she be psyching,   
  too?&nbsp;<br>
  Not this lady, I said to myself. Now what could I do?&nbsp;</font>  
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">But partner, bless him, bid Three   
  Hearts. His cuebid was my break!&nbsp;<br>  
  I could pass, and so would Daughter, thinking we'd made a &quot;mistake&quot;.&nbsp;<br>  
  But Mother looked at her ten-count. She'd paid her entry fee.&nbsp;<br>  
  She came to play and so she bid &quot;Three Spades&quot; in front of me.&nbsp;</font>  
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">My heart sank, I cautiously   
  passed, and so did LHO.&nbsp;<br>  
  We're out of this fix, I thought to myself, but partner couldn't know.&nbsp;<br>  
  He bid Four Diamonds, I tried Four Hearts, but my message went&nbsp;   
  undetected.&nbsp;<br>
  The Grape kept on bidding minors, which I quietly &quot;corrected&quot;.&nbsp;</font>  
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Daughter kept passing, never   
  giving a hint&nbsp;<br>  
  That she knew we were in trouble.&nbsp;<br>  
  But at Six Hearts, she'd heard enough, and finally whispered,   
  &quot;Double&quot;.&nbsp;<br>
  I give up!!!&quot; The Grape exclaimed, cards flying through the air.&nbsp;<br>  
  But the suffering wasn't over, for The Grape had to declare.&nbsp;</font>  
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&quot;I can't imagine what you   
  could have,&quot; he mumbled with a frown.&nbsp;<br>  
  &quot;Unless it's THAT!&quot; he said disgustedly, as I put the dummy down.&nbsp;<br>  
  &quot;In case you haven't noticed,&quot; he snarled, &quot;I'm not blessed   
  with your insight.&nbsp;<br>  
  I'm a simple, trusting partner . . . who can NEVER read a psych!&quot;&nbsp;</font>  
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">My apologies were most profuse as   
  I feebly tried to explain&nbsp;<br>  
  About trying to be imaginative and avoiding the mundane.&nbsp;<br>  
  We went down three for a zero, but he didn't utter another word&nbsp;<br>  
  Except for a threatening grumble when he saw our section third.</font></p>  
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">&nbsp; * * * * * * * * * *</font></b></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">I never thought he'd play with me, 
  or even speak to me again.<br>
  But the very next day I saw him, at the session's end.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">He waved at me and called my name,   
  as he elbowed through the crowd.<br>  
  And in one breath he blurted out, clear and sour and loud:<br>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I just picked up eight solid hearts, playing against   
  a good pair.<br>  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I overcalled the `mundane' Four Hearts, and got a top -- <b>SO   
  THERE!</b>&quot;</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">And with that he stalked away, but 
  the lesson stayed with me.<br>
  It's one that's improved not only my scores, but my partnership harmony.<br>
  For to this day, when about to succumb to a fit of cleverness,<br>
  I think of The Grape, and save myself, by going with the obvious.<br>
