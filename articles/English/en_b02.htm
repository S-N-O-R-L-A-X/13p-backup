  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Balancing after both opponents 
  have bid</font></h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When the opponents have stopped at 
  a low-level contract, you will often want to make a balancing bid or takeout 
  double to try to find a contract of your own. Fairly aggressive balancing bids 
  are especially popular at matchpoint (pairs) play, where the rewards can be 
  great. However, there is some risk in entering the auction after the opponents 
  have exchanged information, so you should adopt a more conservative balancing 
  style in IMP (team) games and rubber bridge.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">To determine whether or not you 
  should reopen the bidding in these situations, keep these general rules in 
  mind:</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="3">The BEST time to 
      balance is when:</font></strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="3">The opponents have stopped 
        in a low-level suit partscore (1 or 2) -- especially if it's possible 
        that you can find a 2-level contract of your own (they've stopped in 2C, 
        2D or 2H or below).</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="3">The opponents have found a 
        trump fit (they have bid and raised a suit).</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="3">The opponents have limited 
        their high-card strength (they have willingly stopped in a part score).</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="3">You have length and 
        high-card strength in the unbid suit(s).</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="3">You're not vulnerable. The 
        opponents will be less tempted to double because a set would only score 
        +100 instead of +110 or +140.</font></li>
    </ol>
  </dl>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="2">The WORST situations 
      for balancing are when:</font></strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You are extremely weak 
        (fewer than 7-8 pts.).</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You have a strong holding in 
        their suit or you suspect they have a better contract available.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The opponents haven't found 
        a good trump fit (they've stopped in 1NT or had an auction that suggests 
        a misfit). Typical non-fitting auctions are: 1H-1NT; 1C-1S-1NT-P; 
        1C-1H-2C-2H; 1H-1S-2D-P .</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your honor cards are in the 
        opponents' suits (especially the suit bid on your left).</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You're vulnerable -- the 
        opponents are more likely to double because a one-trick set (+200) will 
        be greater than the value of their part score.</font></li>
    </ol>
  </dl>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><u><font size="2">How strong is partner's hand?</font></u></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If the opponents find a trump fit 
  and stop at 2, you can USUALLY assume that:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">They have a combined average 
      of about 22 HCPs and your side has an average of 18 HCPs. Subtract your 
      HCPs from 18 to determine about how many points partner will have.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">They have a 8 trumps and you 
      have 5. Subtract the number of cards you hold in their suit from 5 to 
      determine partner's length in their suit. The shorter he is in their suit, 
      the more likely he'll have a fit for YOUR suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You and partner are likely to 
      have an 8-card fit somewhere.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The opponents aren't crazy. 
      Don't worry too much about balancing them into a game. If they haven't 
      made a try for game, assume they WANTED to stop where they did.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>If the opponents stop 
  in 1NT</u></strong> (they bid 1C-1H-1NT or 1D-1NT, etc.):</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Balancing in the pass-out seat is 
  somewhat risky because the opponents don't have a fit. You'll want to have 
  some extra strength to balance over these auctions. As a result, most of your 
  actions suggest at least moderate length in the suit bid on your right 
  (because if you had shortness in that suit, you probably would have made a bid 
  earlier in the auction).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some pairs like to play a double 
  in these auctions as a &quot;trap pass&quot;, showing a strong holding in the 
  suit bid on your right. In this case, responder shouldn't be afraid to pass 
  and lead dummy's suit.</font>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Balancing Actions</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you're in the pass-out seat 
  after the opponents stop in a part score, the meanings of your bids are:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Double </strong>(1H-Pass-2H-Pass 
      / Pass-<strong>DBL</strong>) = For takeout. You may be fairly light for 
      this action if you have the right shape (shortness in their suit). A 
      typical hand for a balancing double after the opponents stop in 2H would 
      be:<br>
      <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><strong>QJ72 <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">2 
      <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ76 <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">Q1053 
      </strong>.<br>
      <br>
      </font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Suit bid </strong>(1H-Pass-2H-Pass 
      / Pass-<strong>2S</strong>) = A one-suited hand that doesn't have the 
      right pattern for a takeout double. Your failure to make a direct overcall 
      at your first turn tells partner that your suit may not be robust:<br>
      <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><strong>J7432 <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">832 
      <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">A7 <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K107 
      </strong>.<br>
      <br>
      </font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Notrump</strong> 
      (1H-Pass-2H-Pass / Pass-<strong>2NT</strong>) = Unusual, showing length in 
      the two lowest unbid suits (usually the minors). A balancing bid of 2NT is 
      never natural; partner should always pull this to one of your suits. If 
      the opponents stop in 2H, your balance of 2NT would show a hand like:<br>
      <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><strong>7 <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">J72 
      <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ104 <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ972</strong> 
      .</font></li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responding to Partner's Balancing 
  Bid</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When partner balances over the 
  opponent's low-level contract, it's important to remember that he has 
  essentially already bid your cards for you. Your partnership's goal is to find 
  a fit and a safe part score, <i><b>not</b></i> to bid a game.</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>If partner balances 
      with a suit</strong>, the best advice is <i><b>don't</b></i> bid on at 
      all. Unless you have a great fit and extraordinary playing strength --or 
      no fit, but a good suit of your own -- you should pass.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>If partner balances 
      with a double</strong>, resist the temptation to jump in your suit. 
      Respond your longest suit at the lowest level available. You may pass the 
      double for penalty if you have a long, strong holding in the opponent's 
      suit.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>If partner balances 
      with an Unusual 2NT</strong> (showing the minors), he is warning you that 
      he has no support for the unbid major. Just bid 3 of your longest minor, 
      even if it's just a 2-card suit.</font></li>
