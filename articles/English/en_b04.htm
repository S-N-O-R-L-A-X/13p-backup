  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Opening Leads: When to be passive</font></h2>
  <hr width="100%">
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some auctions (such as those where 
  the opponents have shown a good source of tricks outside the trump suit) call 
  for an aggressive, potentially risky opening lead -- one that will probably 
  give away a trick if partner has no honors in the suit, but may set the 
  contract if he does. On other hands, you need to be more patient and let 
  declarer work for all his tricks. Your goal on these hands is to make a safe 
  opening lead that won't give declarer an undeserved trick.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A &quot;safe&quot; lead may also 
  be an attacking combination -- such as a suit headed by AK, KQJ or QJ10 -- and 
  these are usually good choices for a lead to any contract. You won't always be 
  dealt these easy holdings, though, so you'll sometimes have to select a 
  &quot;passive&quot; lead. Passive leads include:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A lead from a topless suit 
      (such as 8754), especially one in which you don't expect partner to hold 
      an honor. When in doubt, lead <b><i>through </i></b>strength by choosing a 
      suit dummy (rather than declarer) has bid.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A lead from length -- such as 
      fourth best from Q9653 or K87432. Even though underleading an honor is 
      &quot;standard&quot; to a notrump contract, it can be risky against a suit 
      contract. Length, however, gives you a margin of safety -- the longer your 
      suit, the less likely it is that declarer will need to develop his own 
      tricks in it.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A trump, in some cases.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>How do you know when one of 
  these passive leads is your best choice? </b>Here are some of the contracts 
  and types of auctions that call for a safe, non-attacking opening lead:</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>1 - The opponents are in 6NT or 
  a grand slam.</b>&nbsp; An exception is if the opponents bid 6NT after an 
  auction that suggests that declarer's main source of tricks will be a long, 
  strong suit. In this case, you may want to make an aggressive opening lead 
  (away from an honor) to try to set up a trick you can cash if you get the lead 
  later.<br>
  &nbsp; <b>2 - The auction tells you that declarer has a strong hand and dummy 
  (and/or partner) will be weak.</b></font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Suppose your right-hand opponent 
  opens 2NT (20-22 pts.) and left-hand-opponent raises to 3NT. What's your lead 
  from:<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>987&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ92&nbsp; 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ54&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">Q7</b> 
  ?</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you follow the 
  &quot;fourth-down-from-your-longest-and-strongest&quot; rule, you'd choose the 
  2 of hearts or the 5 of diamonds. But with almost all the outstanding honors 
  on your right, either of these leads has an unusually high risk of giving 
  declarer a &quot;free&quot; trick. Partner can't hold more than 3 high-card 
  points, so it's not a good idea to count on him for help in a specific suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A better choice is a passive 9 of 
  spades. A spade is unlikely to set up any quick tricks for your side, but it 
  probably won't help declarer. Declarer will have to give you the lead soon, 
  and if your spade lead was indeed &quot;safe,&quot; you should probably 
  continue leading them. If a switch is called for, you'll have a better idea of 
  what suit to choose later.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Note that you do <b><i>not</i></b> 
  want to lead a diamond honor. A diamond will probably only be right if partner 
  has the jack or ace, so if you did want to lead diamonds, the correct lead 
  from this holding would be the 4. If partner has no honors -- and declarer has 
  a holding like AJ109 -- leading the king will give him <b><i>three </i></b>eventual 
  tricks. If you instead lead low, declarer can't take more than 2 tricks in the 
  suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">3 - The auction suggests that 
  both opponents are fairly balanced.</font></b>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">On these hands, declarer will 
  usually have to play the side suits himself, so it's best to sit back and wait 
  for your tricks. For example, suppose you're South holding:<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>J1042&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">5&nbsp; 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">10843&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K1032</b><br>
  and it's your lead after your opponents have the following auction:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>West&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East

</u></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1H&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2NT*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * (Jacoby 2NT, forcing heart raise)</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With the Jacoby 2NT convention, 
  East's 4H bid showed a minimum opener with no singleton and no interest in 
  slam. Although the opponents have game-level strength, they rate to be fairly 
  balanced -- opener had an opportunity to show a singleton over 2NT, and 
  responder might have chosen a different forcing bid if he had a very 
  distributional hand. You expect that declarer will have to lead the side suits 
  himself, so you want to avoid any suit that will make his job easier.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The singleton trump is probably 
  the most dangerous lead you can make (partner won't be happy if he holds Qxx 
  of trumps!). It's also risky to lead away from the club king, or even the J10 
  of spades. That leaves you with your &quot;nothing&quot; suit -- diamonds -- 
  so try the diamond 3.</font>
