  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">The Missing Redouble Cards</font></h2>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Jack Spear, Kansas City MO, 
  tests his marriage.</b>&nbsp;</font>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In the &quot;Bits and Pieces&quot; 
  column in the July 1997 <i>Bridge World</i> magazine, Harry Ross of Des Moines 
  IA offered a humorous anecdote about a couple he had played against in a 
  recent tournament. His story, entitled &quot;Cut his tongue out?&quot;, 
  begins:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&quot;Three times he redoubled. 
    Three times the contract failed. They lost the regional knockout by the 
    narrowest of margins. His wife and bridge partner was seething.&quot;</font>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Two days later, Harry had an 
  interesting encounter with the same couple when he played them in the Swiss 
  teams. On one deal, Harry doubled the husband's 1NT opening and the wife 
  passed. The husband alerted the pass, explaining that it asked him to redouble 
  if it was passed back to him. Then he added, sheepishly, &quot;But I 
  can't.&quot;</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The husband's dilemma had come 
  because his wife had removed all the blue Redouble cards from his bidding box. 
  After some negotiation and rummaging through her purse, she grudgingly loaned 
  him one, and only one,&nbsp; Redouble card for this auction only.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The couple wasn't named in the 
  article, but by the end of the first paragraph, I was fairly certain it was my 
  friends Jack and Nancy Spear of Kansas City. Sure enough, a few weeks later, I 
  got an email from Jack with a quiz about how to play a redoubled contract. It 
  was one of the three offending hands from the knockout event.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Jack held:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>KQJ1065&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">Void&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AKJ865&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">J&nbsp; 
  </b>and the auction proceeded:.<br>

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">He was greeted by this dummy:&nbsp;<img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><b>Void&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A97654&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">72&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">Q9854</b></font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Jack got the helpful lead of the 
  heart queen, allowing him to pitch his club loser on dummy's ace. His partner 
  scowled when she saw the club honor, and Jack was wishing he had passed 4C 
  doubled, if for no other reason than for marital harmony.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Still, this looked like a fairly 
  easy make. Jack wrote: &quot;Making 6, or even 7, was not impossible, but I 
  didn't want any 'Greedy Pig' stories, so I tried to select a simple, safe line 
  for a mere 11 tricks. But what would be a safe line anyway? I suspected there 
  may be distribution afoot . . .&quot;</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">What's your line of play? At the 
  table, Jack decided the safest plan would be to lead a diamond to the ace and 
  ruff one spade in dummy, hoping to lose no more than the spade ace and one 
  diamond trick later. That backfired, though, when his RHO showed up with Q10xx 
  of diamonds, and Jack was down one for -400.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Later, Jack realized that he 
  should have known to finesse the diamond. He said the clue to the correct play 
  -- a diamond to the jack at trick 2 -- was LHO's 4C bid, which should be a 
  5-card suit. That leaves RHO, who showed a takeout double of spades, with a 
  doubleton club, so he must be 2-5-4-2. &quot;Easy to see after the hand,&quot; 
  Jack said.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">So that was the story behind one 
  of the disastrous redoubles from that session. Jack didn't provide any details 
  about the other two. He did, however, offer in his defense: &quot;So after one 
  redouble goes wrong, the second one is easier, and the third. Kind of like a 
  serial killer, I would imagine.&quot;</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">By the way . . . In spite of -- or 
  thanks to -- the absent redouble cards, Jack and Nancy won the Flight A Swiss 
  Teams that day.&nbsp;<br>
