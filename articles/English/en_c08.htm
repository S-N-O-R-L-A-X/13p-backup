      <font size="2">Part 4 -- Creating penalty
        situations</font>
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Our District 8 bidding panel came
        up with four different interpretations of partner's double in this auction:</font>
    <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO&nbsp;</u>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2H&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL</font></pre>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The panel plurality was sure the
        double was pure penalty. Others said it was a light takeout with four spades,
        but not enough strength for a first-round negative double. A third group
        thought partner had a stronger takeout (8-9 pts.) with only three spades. And
        finally, some said they'd treat the double as &quot;two-way&quot; -- they
        would look at their heart length to decide what partner meant.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Although most panelists thought
        there was a logical answer, a few were annoyed with their fictional partner.
        Among their comments: &quot;Partner is just trying to torture me with an
        impossible double that can't be fielded without a special agreement.&quot;</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The popular approach of &quot;when
        in doubt, it's takeout&quot; might have you thinking twice about partner's
        intent here. Even if your judgment told you this should be a penalty double,
        you might pull out of fear that partner thought otherwise.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Modern bidding has created so many
        new forms of competitive doubles that problems like this one are becoming more
        frequent. Since it's virtually impossible to discuss every situation that
        might come up at the table, it's helpful to have default agreements you can
        apply to a wide range of auctions.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In previous articles, we looked at
        penalty doubles after notrump bids. Although there are important exceptions,
        the general default is that a double is for penalty if there's been a natural
        notrump bid -- by us or the opponents -- earlier in the auction.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">There are several other types of
        auctions that also set up penalty situations. One standard default is:</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b><u>Default #1:</u></b> A
        double is penalty if either of us has made a card-showing double or redouble
        earlier.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">These are auctions where you've
        shown a willingness to penalize a future bid by the opponents. One of the most
        common is when you redouble an opponent's takeout double (1C by partner - DBL
        by RHO - RDBL by you). Another penalty situation is created when you double a
        Michaels Cuebid or Unusual Notrump overcall. After these starts, any
        subsequent double by you or partner should be treated as penalty.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Some pairs use the double of a
        Michaels cuebid to show support for opener's suit, but this has little value.
        If you have trumps, it's usually more effective to raise. Instead, a direct
        double is best used as card-showing (around 10+ pts.) with a desire to
        penalize one or both of overcaller's suits.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Another &quot;universal&quot;
        default is :</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b><u>Default #2</u>:</b> A
        double is penalty if either of us has made an earlier penalty double (or
        penalty pass of a takeout double).</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Takeout and responsive doubles are
        &quot;off&quot; in any auction where you've already attempted to penalize the
        opponents. These include auctions like:</font>
    <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO
</u>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;1C&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1NT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(2)&nbsp; --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2H&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(3)&nbsp; 1D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></pre>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If the opponents bid again in
        these auctions, any double by you or partner is penalty.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Note that this default does <b><i>not</i></b>
        apply to just any second double. For example, if you make a takeout or
        negative double and then double again, as in:</font>
    <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>RHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner</u>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL</font></pre>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">it's not a penalty double. Since
        neither of you has made a penalty double in between, this double is simply
        &quot;re-takeout&quot;, showing extra values.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Putting your defaults to work</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Can you apply either of these two
        defaults to the problem we started with? You can if you extend Default #2, as
        many pairs do, to include auctions where it's <b><i>likely</i></b> partner had
        a trap-pass.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This requires judgment, and it may
        depend somewhat on your bidding style. In the auction at the beginning of this
        article, if partner would have made a first-round negative double with&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif"
          width="13" height="11">K1074&nbsp;
        <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">62&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13"
          height="11">K985&nbsp;
        <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">1054, then his delayed double
        now shouldn't be a light takeout. With a hand weaker than this, he should have
        been content to stay out of the auction.
      </font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Similarly, some partners would
        have made an off-shape negative double (or responded 1NT) with<br>
        <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ5&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13"
          height="11">J62&nbsp;
        <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K9852&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">75
        .
      </font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If this is your style, partner
        probably doesn't have the hand with three spades and moderate values. And if
        his strength were a bit more concentrated -- such as&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13"
          height="11">84&nbsp;
        <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">632&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13"
          height="11">AJ1082&nbsp;
        <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">Q103 -- he could balance with
        2NT as a minor-suit takeout.
      </font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">How about the look-at-your-trumps
        theory? Those who thought partner's double was &quot;two-way&quot; would
        interpret it as a trump stack if they held heart shortness. If they held three
        or four hearts, they would deduce that partner was probably short in hearts
        and therefore meant his double as takeout.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Playing these two-way doubles can
        be dangerous, especially against timid opponents who might stop at the
        two-level with a 9- or even a 10-card fit. If both you and partner are short
        in their suit, it's almost guaranteed that you'll misinterpret a reopening
        double. And anytime you hold a doubleton in their suit, you'll be guessing.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">That leaves the penalty double.
        Whenever partner <b><i>might</i></b> <b><i>have</i></b> had a penalty pass on
        the previous round, you should at least consider this interpretation. Of
        course, when the opponents have freely raised a suit, it's difficult to
        picture partner with a trap-pass, but it's not that uncommon. The overcall
        might be a 4-card suit, and even if the opponents have an 8-card fit, partner
        could have a trump stack in a hand like&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">A63&nbsp;
        <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ107&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13"
          height="11">K1062&nbsp;
        <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">65.
      </font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Finally, here's one more default
        that may help you handle this type of problem:</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b><u>Default #3:</u></b> It's a
        penalty double if the doubler's partner has accurately described his strength
        and distribution.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Does this apply to the original
        problem? There's a good case for it. Opener had the opportunity to show extra
        values over 2H, so his pass implies a minimum. A nothing-special opener
        opposite a hand that didn't have the strength or pattern to compete on the
        first round doesn't add up to much offense. That makes a takeout double less
        attractive, and offers a stronger argument for the penalty interpretation.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">As always, though, the
        &quot;right&quot; answer here depends on your agreements (or lack of them).
        Using these defaults won't stop your partner from making ambiguous doubles,
        but at least you -- and he -- will have guidelines you can use to interpret
        them.<br>

      <font size="2">The most widely accepted meaning
        of all these doubles is penalty. But would you be sure at the table? Or would
        you be wondering if a few were some type of exotic takeout?</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Modern bidding has popularized so
        many uses for doubles that it's becoming difficult to tell the difference
        between takeout and old-fashioned penalty doubles. To solve these problems,
        many pairs rely on general default agreements they can apply to a wide range
        of situations.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In previous articles, we looked at
        defaults for doubles in auctions where there had been natural notrump bids,
        penalty doubles and card-showing doubles and redoubles. Other penalty
        situations are created when we've already found our trump suit, or it's clear
        there's no fit left to find, as in the auctions above.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Here are four additional defaults
        you can use to handle problems like these. They're all &quot;modern
        standard&quot; -- the meanings you could assume if these doubles came up in a
        new partnership with an experienced player. There's plenty of room for
        refinement, though, so if you have a regular partnership, these defaults are a
        good starting point for more discussion.</font>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">When you and partner have bid and
        raised and suit -- as in (A) and (B) above -- there's no point in using a
        double to suggest anything other than a desire to defend.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">An obvious exception comes if you
        play maximal game-try doubles, but these auctions don't fit the requirements
        for this convention. We'll discuss how your defaults and conventions work
        together in a future article.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">At matchpoints, many pairs do
        choose to modify the meaning of the double in Auction (A). A popular agreement
        is that this double -- whether by opener or responder -- doesn't promise a
        trump stack. It merely shows maximum defense and moderate length in the
        opponent's suit, and you can pull with extra spade length or distributional
        values. In (A), partner might hold<br>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This type of
        &quot;bid-or-pull&quot; double is often called cooperative. Although its
        popularity is growing, it's not so widely accepted that I would try it with a
        new partner. When in doubt (or when at IMPs), you should rely on the general
        default to interpret an undiscussed double. We'll feature other uses of
        cooperative doubles in a future article.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In Auction (B), your default
        should tell you that partner's double must be penalty. He should have a hand

      <font size="2">Here, there's no guarantee partner
        has 4 spades, so your response didn't necessarily set the trump suit. A widely

    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This includes doubles after we
        make a preemptive opening bid, a weak jump overcall, a weak jump shift or a
        preemptive raise. In all these cases, the preemptor has shown no interest in

        doubles.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">That means partner's double in (C)
        is 100% penalty. No matter how much he'd like to make a game try or show the
        majors or get you to further describe your hand, he won't violate the standard
        default by trying a double. The only way he has to look for another fit is to
        bid a long suit of his own.</font>

      <font size="2"><b><u>Default #3</u></b>: A

    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The principle here is similar to
        Default #2. If you double an artificial bid (and you have no agreement about a
        special meaning), you're just showing that suit and directing a lead. In
        Auction (D), all partner can safely assume is that you have a diamond one-suiter,
        so his double doesn't request you to do anything but pass. If he had enough to
        justify a takeout at this level, he would have acted directly over 1H.</font>

      <font size="2"><b><u>Default #4</u></b>: A
        double is penalty if there are NO unbid suits.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This includes auctions in which
        all four suits haven't been directly bid, but have been shown or implied. In
        Auction (E), the opponents have shown length in clubs, diamonds and hearts, so
        partner can't mean his double as any sort of takeout. He has a powerhouse and
        a heart stack.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">You can also assume a suit is
        &quot;bid&quot; if it's been shown with a takeout double, as in Auction (F).
        Here, partner's first double suggested club length, so his double of 2C shows
        extra values and strong clubs. There's also an inference that he doesn't have
        4 hearts, but you're free to pull if you have extra heart length and short
        clubs.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This default is often extended to
        auctions where there's just <b><i>one</i></b> unbid suit, but there are many
        exceptions. One popular one is opener's double after the specific auction
        1C-(Pass)-1D-(1S), which some pairs use to show 4 hearts.<br>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Even if you were certain that all
        these doubles <b><i>should</i></b> be penalty, you might still be nervous if
        they were passed back around to you. The growing popularity of takeout-type
        doubles has made many of us suspicious that any slightly unusual double has
        some non-penalty meaning.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Problems like these demonstrate
        the value of default agreements -- simple guidelines you can apply to
        situations that aren't covered by your other agreements or conventions. In
        previous articles, we looked at several types of auctions where the
        &quot;standard&quot; default is that a double is penalty.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The three defaults below are
        broader principles that encompass many of the situations we discussed earlier.
        They can also be used as &quot;when-in-doubt&quot; guidelines in auctions that
        don't seem to fit any of your other defaults.</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b><u>Default #1</u></b>: A
        double is penalty if the doubler's partner has accurately described his
        strength and distribution.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This applies to auctions where we
        haven't confirmed a trump fit, but each of us has already made a constructive
        call, as in (A) above. Here, you've limited your hand, shown extra club length
        and denied 3-card spade support, so partner can't realistically expect to find
        out more with a takeout double.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This default also covers auctions
        where the doubler's partner has shown a two-suiter, as in (B). Partner's
        double is penalty because he already knows enough about your suit length to
        decide on a trump suit. Your Michaels cuebid essentially said, &quot;Choose
        one of my long suits&quot;, so it's pointless for a double to mean &quot;No,
        you choose.&quot; The same applies if partner doubles after you make a
        two-suited takeout double (1C-Pass-1H-<b><i>DBL</i></b>).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Another common use of this
        principle is covered by the default we discussed in Part 5: &quot;It's a
        penalty double if we've already found our fit.&quot; You can assume you've
        given partner accurate information in most auctions where you've bid and
        raised a suit, as in (C). Unless you've agreed to play this as cooperative,
        partner's double must be penalty, showing four strong hearts and some extra
        values.</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b><u>Default #2</u></b>: A
        double is penalty if the doubler had an earlier opportunity to describe his
        strength and distribution.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This one is a little trickier to
        sort out, and depends somewhat on your style. Without a discussion, I'd
        probably be afraid to treat the double in Auction (D) as anything but takeout,
        but there's a good case for applying this default and defining it as penalty.
        The opponents haven't confirmed a fit, so what hand can partner hold that
        wasn't worth a first-round takeout, but is now strong enough to risk a 3-level
        to contract?</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This default is easier apply if
        you lighten up your requirements for initial takeout doubles. If partner can
        make a light, shape double on the first round with&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13"
          height="11">AQ76&nbsp;
        <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">5&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13"
          height="11">KJ103&nbsp;
        <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">10932 , then his delayed
        double in auctions like this (where opener has rebid a major after a one-level
        response) should show a trump stack:&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">52&nbsp;
        <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ107&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13"
          height="11">AK72&nbsp;
        <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ4 .
      </font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Similarly, this default covers
        many auctions where it's responder who makes a delayed double. If he had an
        earlier chance to bid or make a negative double, you should consider the
        possibility that he had a penalty pass. What else could partner have in
        Auction (E)? He passed originally because he was waiting to double 1S, and
        he's now showing that he also has a strong heart holding.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Note that this default does <b><i>not</i></b>
        apply to an auction like:</font>
    <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;</u>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL</font></pre>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Here, there's a logical reason
        partner didn't double at his first turn: he was short in hearts. Now that
        hearts have been bid, he's showing a takeout for clubs and spades.</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b><u>Default #3</u></b>: A
        double is penalty if the doubler had a good alternative.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This default gives you a slightly
        different approach to solving some of the problems above. You can use it by
        asking yourself a few questions: &quot;What undisclosed feature could I have
        that partner might be looking for?&quot; and &quot;Did he have a clearer way
        to ask me about it, or to describe his own hand?&quot;</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The answers may help you determine
        why partner chose a double instead of another action. In Auction (A), for
        example, the only possible feature of your hand that could interest partner is
        a heart stopper, but he could have cuebid 3H to find that.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In (B), there may be some value in
        playing this double as a major-suit game-try, but partner would never torture
        you by inventing this at the table -- he would just bid one of your suits if
        he had support.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In (C), you've already denied
        holding 4 spades, so partner can't be searching for another fit. And if he had
        wanted to try for a notrump or diamond game, he could have bid 2S, 3C or 3H.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">You can also apply this principle
        to (D) and a variation of it where the opponents bid 1H-1S-2H. A double after
        this auction should also be penalty because partner had 2NT available as a
        minor-suit takeout.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">And in (E), partner had numerous
        ways to show values and/or interest in your two possible trump suits -- he
        could raise clubs, bid diamonds or notrump, or cuebid 2S or 3H.<br>
