  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Default Agreements: Was that a 
  penalty double ?</font></h2>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Part 4 -- Creating penalty 
  situations</font></h3>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Our District 8 bidding panel came 
  up with four different interpretations of partner's double in this auction:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO&nbsp;</u>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2H&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The panel plurality was sure the 
  double was pure penalty. Others said it was a light takeout with four spades, 
  but not enough strength for a first-round negative double. A third group 
  thought partner had a stronger takeout (8-9 pts.) with only three spades. And 
  finally, some said they'd treat the double as &quot;two-way&quot; -- they 
  would look at their heart length to decide what partner meant.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Although most panelists thought 
  there was a logical answer, a few were annoyed with their fictional partner. 
  Among their comments: &quot;Partner is just trying to torture me with an 
  impossible double that can't be fielded without a special agreement.&quot;</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The popular approach of &quot;when 
  in doubt, it's takeout&quot; might have you thinking twice about partner's 
  intent here. Even if your judgment told you this should be a penalty double, 
  you might pull out of fear that partner thought otherwise.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Modern bidding has created so many 
  new forms of competitive doubles that problems like this one are becoming more 
  frequent. Since it's virtually impossible to discuss every situation that 
  might come up at the table, it's helpful to have default agreements you can 
  apply to a wide range of auctions.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In previous articles, we looked at 
  penalty doubles after notrump bids. Although there are important exceptions, 
  the general default is that a double is for penalty if there's been a natural 
  notrump bid -- by us or the opponents -- earlier in the auction.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">There are several other types of 
  auctions that also set up penalty situations. One standard default is:</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Default #1:</u></b> A 
  double is penalty if either of us has made a card-showing double or redouble 
  earlier.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">These are auctions where you've 
  shown a willingness to penalize a future bid by the opponents. One of the most 
  common is when you redouble an opponent's takeout double (1C by partner - DBL 
  by RHO - RDBL by you). Another penalty situation is created when you double a 
  Michaels Cuebid or Unusual Notrump overcall. After these starts, any 
  subsequent double by you or partner should be treated as penalty.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Some pairs use the double of a 
  Michaels cuebid to show support for opener's suit, but this has little value. 
  If you have trumps, it's usually more effective to raise. Instead, a direct 
  double is best used as card-showing (around 10+ pts.) with a desire to 
  penalize one or both of overcaller's suits.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Another &quot;universal&quot; 
  default is :</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Default #2</u>:</b> A 
  double is penalty if either of us has made an earlier penalty double (or 
  penalty pass of a takeout double).</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Takeout and responsive doubles are 
  &quot;off&quot; in any auction where you've already attempted to penalize the 
  opponents. These include auctions like:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO
</u>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;1C&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1NT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(2)&nbsp; --&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2H&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

(3)&nbsp; 1D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If the opponents bid again in 
  these auctions, any double by you or partner is penalty.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Note that this default does <b><i>not</i></b> 
  apply to just any second double. For example, if you make a takeout or 
  negative double and then double again, as in:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>RHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner</u>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">it's not a penalty double. Since 
  neither of you has made a penalty double in between, this double is simply 
  &quot;re-takeout&quot;, showing extra values.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Putting your defaults to work</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Can you apply either of these two 
  defaults to the problem we started with? You can if you extend Default #2, as 
  many pairs do, to include auctions where it's <b><i>likely</i></b> partner had 
  a trap-pass.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This requires judgment, and it may 
  depend somewhat on your bidding style. In the auction at the beginning of this 
  article, if partner would have made a first-round negative double with&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">K1074&nbsp; 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">62&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K985&nbsp; 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">1054, then his delayed double 
  now shouldn't be a light takeout. With a hand weaker than this, he should have 
  been content to stay out of the auction.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Similarly, some partners would 
  have made an off-shape negative double (or responded 1NT) with<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ5&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">J62&nbsp; 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K9852&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">75 
  .</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If this is your style, partner 
  probably doesn't have the hand with three spades and moderate values. And if 
  his strength were a bit more concentrated -- such as&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">84&nbsp; 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">632&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ1082&nbsp; 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">Q103 -- he could balance with 
  2NT as a minor-suit takeout.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">How about the look-at-your-trumps 
  theory? Those who thought partner's double was &quot;two-way&quot; would 
  interpret it as a trump stack if they held heart shortness. If they held three 
  or four hearts, they would deduce that partner was probably short in hearts 
  and therefore meant his double as takeout.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Playing these two-way doubles can 
  be dangerous, especially against timid opponents who might stop at the 
  two-level with a 9- or even a 10-card fit. If both you and partner are short 
  in their suit, it's almost guaranteed that you'll misinterpret a reopening 
  double. And anytime you hold a doubleton in their suit, you'll be guessing.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">That leaves the penalty double. 
  Whenever partner <b><i>might</i></b> <b><i>have</i></b> had a penalty pass on 
  the previous round, you should at least consider this interpretation. Of 
  course, when the opponents have freely raised a suit, it's difficult to 
  picture partner with a trap-pass, but it's not that uncommon. The overcall 
  might be a 4-card suit, and even if the opponents have an 8-card fit, partner 
  could have a trump stack in a hand like&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">A63&nbsp; 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ107&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K1062&nbsp; 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">65.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Finally, here's one more default 
  that may help you handle this type of problem:</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Default #3:</u></b> It's a 
  penalty double if the doubler's partner has accurately described his strength 
  and distribution.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Does this apply to the original 
  problem? There's a good case for it. Opener had the opportunity to show extra 
  values over 2H, so his pass implies a minimum. A nothing-special opener 
  opposite a hand that didn't have the strength or pattern to compete on the 
  first round doesn't add up to much offense. That makes a takeout double less 
  attractive, and offers a stronger argument for the penalty interpretation.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">As always, though, the 
  &quot;right&quot; answer here depends on your agreements (or lack of them). 
  Using these defaults won't stop your partner from making ambiguous doubles, 
  but at least you -- and he -- will have guidelines you can use to interpret 
  them.<br>

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The most widely accepted meaning 
  of all these doubles is penalty. But would you be sure at the table? Or would 
  you be wondering if a few were some type of exotic takeout?</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Modern bidding has popularized so 
  many uses for doubles that it's becoming difficult to tell the difference 
  between takeout and old-fashioned penalty doubles. To solve these problems, 
  many pairs rely on general default agreements they can apply to a wide range 
  of situations.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In previous articles, we looked at 
  defaults for doubles in auctions where there had been natural notrump bids, 
  penalty doubles and card-showing doubles and redoubles. Other penalty 
  situations are created when we've already found our trump suit, or it's clear 
  there's no fit left to find, as in the auctions above.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here are four additional defaults 
  you can use to handle problems like these. They're all &quot;modern 
  standard&quot; -- the meanings you could assume if these doubles came up in a 
  new partnership with an experienced player. There's plenty of room for 
  refinement, though, so if you have a regular partnership, these defaults are a 
  good starting point for more discussion.</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Default #1</u></b>: A 
  double is penalty if we've already found our fit.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When you and partner have bid and 
  raised and suit -- as in (A) and (B) above -- there's no point in using a 
  double to suggest anything other than a desire to defend.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">An obvious exception comes if you 
  play maximal game-try doubles, but these auctions don't fit the requirements 
  for this convention. We'll discuss how your defaults and conventions work 
  together in a future article.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">At matchpoints, many pairs do 
  choose to modify the meaning of the double in Auction (A). A popular agreement 
  is that this double -- whether by opener or responder -- doesn't promise a 
  trump stack. It merely shows maximum defense and moderate length in the 
  opponent's suit, and you can pull with extra spade length or distributional 
  values. In (A), partner might hold<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">1065&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">K54&nbsp; 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">Q102&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">A764 
  .</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This type of 
  &quot;bid-or-pull&quot; double is often called cooperative. Although its 
  popularity is growing, it's not so widely accepted that I would try it with a 
  new partner. When in doubt (or when at IMPs), you should rely on the general 
  default to interpret an undiscussed double. We'll feature other uses of 
  cooperative doubles in a future article.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In Auction (B), your default 
  should tell you that partner's double must be penalty. He should have a hand 
  like<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AKJ&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">Q10874&nbsp;

  .</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Note that this general default 
  operates only when your auction has confirmed an 8-card fit. That hasn't 
  happened in:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO&nbsp;</u>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here, there's no guarantee partner 
  has 4 spades, so your response didn't necessarily set the trump suit. A widely 
  accepted way to play this second double by the takeout doubler is extra values 
  (18+ pts.), but with only 3-card spade support:<br>
  <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ7&nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">53&nbsp; 
  <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AK83&nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">AQJ6 
  .</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Default #2</u></b>: A 
  double is penalty if either of us has preempted.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This includes doubles after we 
  make a preemptive opening bid, a weak jump overcall, a weak jump shift or a 
  preemptive raise. In all these cases, the preemptor has shown no interest in 
  other suits, so there's no value in playing responsive or takeout-oriented 
  doubles.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">That means partner's double in (C) 
  is 100% penalty. No matter how much he'd like to make a game try or show the 
  majors or get you to further describe your hand, he won't violate the standard 
  default by trying a double. The only way he has to look for another fit is to 
  bid a long suit of his own.</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Default #3</u></b>: A 
  double is penalty if either of us has made an earlier lead-directing double of 
  an artificial bid.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The principle here is similar to 
  Default #2. If you double an artificial bid (and you have no agreement about a 
  special meaning), you're just showing that suit and directing a lead. In 
  Auction (D), all partner can safely assume is that you have a diamond one-suiter, 
  so his double doesn't request you to do anything but pass. If he had enough to 
  justify a takeout at this level, he would have acted directly over 1H.</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Default #4</u></b>: A 
  double is penalty if there are NO unbid suits.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This includes auctions in which 
  all four suits haven't been directly bid, but have been shown or implied. In 
  Auction (E), the opponents have shown length in clubs, diamonds and hearts, so 
  partner can't mean his double as any sort of takeout. He has a powerhouse and 
  a heart stack.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can also assume a suit is 
  &quot;bid&quot; if it's been shown with a takeout double, as in Auction (F). 
  Here, partner's first double suggested club length, so his double of 2C shows 
  extra values and strong clubs. There's also an inference that he doesn't have 
  4 hearts, but you're free to pull if you have extra heart length and short 
  clubs.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This default is often extended to 
  auctions where there's just <b><i>one</i></b> unbid suit, but there are many 
  exceptions. One popular one is opener's double after the specific auction 
  1C-(Pass)-1D-(1S), which some pairs use to show 4 hearts.<br>

  these doubles <b><i>should</i></b> be penalty, you might still be nervous if 
  they were passed back around to you. The growing popularity of takeout-type 
  doubles has made many of us suspicious that any slightly unusual double has 
  some non-penalty meaning.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Problems like these demonstrate 
  the value of default agreements -- simple guidelines you can apply to 
  situations that aren't covered by your other agreements or conventions. In 
  previous articles, we looked at several types of auctions where the 
  &quot;standard&quot; default is that a double is penalty.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The three defaults below are 
  broader principles that encompass many of the situations we discussed earlier.

  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Default #1</u></b>: A 
  double is penalty if the doubler's partner has accurately described his 
  strength and distribution.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This applies to auctions where we 
  haven't confirmed a trump fit, but each of us has already made a constructive 
  call, as in (A) above. Here, you've limited your hand, shown extra club length 
  and denied 3-card spade support, so partner can't realistically expect to find 
  out more with a takeout double.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This default also covers auctions 
  where the doubler's partner has shown a two-suiter, as in (B). Partner's 
  double is penalty because he already knows enough about your suit length to 
  decide on a trump suit. Your Michaels cuebid essentially said, &quot;Choose 
  one of my long suits&quot;, so it's pointless for a double to mean &quot;No, 
  you choose.&quot; The same applies if partner doubles after you make a 
  two-suited takeout double (1C-Pass-1H-<b><i>DBL</i></b>).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Another common use of this 
  principle is covered by the default we discussed in Part 5: &quot;It's a 
  penalty double if we've already found our fit.&quot; You can assume you've 
  given partner accurate information in most auctions where you've bid and 
  raised a suit, as in (C). Unless you've agreed to play this as cooperative, 
  partner's double must be penalty, showing four strong hearts and some extra 
  values.</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Default #2</u></b>: A 
  double is penalty if the doubler had an earlier opportunity to describe his 
  strength and distribution.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This one is a little trickier to 
  sort out, and depends somewhat on your style. Without a discussion, I'd 
  probably be afraid to treat the double in Auction (D) as anything but takeout, 
  but there's a good case for applying this default and defining it as penalty. 
  The opponents haven't confirmed a fit, so what hand can partner hold that 
  wasn't worth a first-round takeout, but is now strong enough to risk a 3-level 
  to contract?</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This default is easier apply if 
  you lighten up your requirements for initial takeout doubles. If partner can 
  make a light, shape double on the first round with&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ76&nbsp; 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">5&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ103&nbsp; 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">10932 , then his delayed 
  double in auctions like this (where opener has rebid a major after a one-level 
  response) should show a trump stack:&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">52&nbsp; 
  <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ107&nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AK72&nbsp; 
  <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ4 .</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Similarly, this default covers 
  many auctions where it's responder who makes a delayed double. If he had an 
  earlier chance to bid or make a negative double, you should consider the 
  possibility that he had a penalty pass. What else could partner have in 
  Auction (E)? He passed originally because he was waiting to double 1S, and 
  he's now showing that he also has a strong heart holding.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Note that this default does <b><i>not</i></b> 
  apply to an auction like:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>LHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partner&nbsp;&nbsp; RHO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You&nbsp;</u>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 1H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DBL</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here, there's a logical reason 
  partner didn't double at his first turn: he was short in hearts. Now that 
  hearts have been bid, he's showing a takeout for clubs and spades.</font>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Default #3</u></b>: A 
  double is penalty if the doubler had a good alternative.</font></h4>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This default gives you a slightly 
  different approach to solving some of the problems above. You can use it by 
  asking yourself a few questions: &quot;What undisclosed feature could I have 
  that partner might be looking for?&quot; and &quot;Did he have a clearer way 
  to ask me about it, or to describe his own hand?&quot;</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The answers may help you determine 
  why partner chose a double instead of another action. In Auction (A), for 
  example, the only possible feature of your hand that could interest partner is 
  a heart stopper, but he could have cuebid 3H to find that.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (B), there may be some value in 
  playing this double as a major-suit game-try, but partner would never torture 
  you by inventing this at the table -- he would just bid one of your suits if 
  he had support.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (C), you've already denied 
  holding 4 spades, so partner can't be searching for another fit. And if he had 
  wanted to try for a notrump or diamond game, he could have bid 2S, 3C or 3H.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can also apply this principle 
  to (D) and a variation of it where the opponents bid 1H-1S-2H. A double after 
  this auction should also be penalty because partner had 2NT available as a 
  minor-suit takeout.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">And in (E), partner had numerous 
  ways to show values and/or interest in your two possible trump suits -- he 
  could raise clubs, bid diamonds or notrump, or cuebid 2S or 3H.<br>
