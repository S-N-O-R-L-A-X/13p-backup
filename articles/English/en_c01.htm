    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The strong jump-shift is one of
        the first special responses new players learn to use and, once discovered,
        it's usually used far too often. One form of abuse, &quot;standard&quot; in
        many party bridge games, is to jump-shift with even a balanced 13-count, just
        to give partner the good news that a game is available.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">With experience, most of us learn
        to abandon this treatment and convert to the old Goren requirement of 19+
        points. But according to many of today's experts, that standard may no longer
        be practical or even correct.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">With some 19-point hands, good
        players wouldn't be caught dead jump-shifting. With some 16-point hands, they
        would always make one. Which is which? In the examples above, a jump-shift is
        recommended with Hands #1 through #4; a simple one-bid works best with Hands
        #5 through #8. Here's why:</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">When to jump-shift</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">A jump-shift always shows a long
        suit and very strong responding hand, but the modern treatment is that it
        doesn't necessarily guarantee 19 high-card points. In fact, the jump-shift can
        be most useful for those hands where you want to invite a slam, not insist on
        one.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">A strong jump-shift should be made
        only when you have a one-suited hand with good honor strength in your suit,
        slam-try strength or better <b><i>and</i></b> a good rebid. An additional
        guideline is that the jump-shift works best when you want to describe <b><i>your</i></b>
        hand to partner (not vice versa). A jump-shift, then, is valuable in
        describing these types of hands:</font>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">A strong hand (17+ pts.) with
            ONE long, strong suit (at least two of the top three honors). Hand #1
            above is &quot;perfect&quot; for a 3C response.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">An intermediate hand (13-16
            pts.)<b> </b>with a long, <b>solid</b> suit and good controls. With Hand
            #2 above, jump to 2S and rebid 4S at your next turn to show the solid
            suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">A balanced slam-invitation (17
            to a &quot;bad&quot; 19 pts.) with a good 5-card suit. With Hand #3, jump
            to 2S, then rebid 3NT to show balanced strength.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">A slam-try or better hand (16+
            pts.) with a good 5+-card suit <b><i>and</i></b> length in opener's suit.
            With Hand #4, jump-shift to 2H, then show your diamond support with your
            next bid.</font>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">And -- most important -- when NOT
        to jump-shift</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Even with very powerful hands, you
        should make a low-level response any time you need general information from
        partner about his strength and distribution. Avoid making a jump-shift with
        the following types of hands:</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">(1) A two- or three-suited hand.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">With Hands like #5 and #6 above,
        you have plenty of high-card strength, but no clear idea about what the trump
        suit should be. You may need a lot of bidding room to show your distribution
        and locate support in partner's hand. Since you want to hear partner's
        natural, length-showing rebid, you should make a one-level response with each
        of these hands and follow up with as many forcing bids as you need.</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">(2) A one-suited hand with a bad
        suit (missing two or more top honors).</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Don't jump-shift into a suit that
        needs <b><i>good</i></b> honor support or length from partner. You'll crowd
        the auction if you jump to 2H with a hand like #7 above. Even if partner
        raises hearts, you won't be able to tell if your suit is running. And whether
        he raises or not, you have no intelligent rebid.</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">(3) A <b><i>very</i></b> strong,
        balanced hand.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">A jump-shift doesn't always
        promise a distributional hand -- it can also be made with a good 5-card suit
        and balanced strength. If you have a balanced powerhouse, though, an initial
        jump-shift can create problems. Because the jump-shift uses up so much bidding
        space, it often leaves opener only one &quot;safe&quot;, below-game rebid to
        describe his hand. He may be hesitant to go past your 3NT rebid if he has a
        two-suited minimum, and he's often unsure of your exact strength.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Best is to limit the
        jump-shifter's 3NT rebid to no more than a good 17 to a &quot;bad&quot; 19 (a
        hand like #3 above). With stronger hands, you may have trouble finding a good
        rebid after your jump-shift, so use the low-level auction.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Hand #8 above came up at a
        sectional. Those players who jump-shifted to 2S heard 3H from partner and were
        at a loss for what to do next. The hand is too strong for 3NT -- partner could
        pass. You can't rebid spades or raise diamonds or hearts, and Blackwood won't
        tell you if partner's suits are running.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">An additional problem arises
        because so few players have discussed the exact meanings of opener's rebids
        after the jump-shift. In the auction above, could partner's 3H show a minimum
        like&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">3&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13"

        where 7NT is laydown? You're more likely to find out about partner's

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In the absence of any special
        agreements, many players would rebid 3C with Hand #1, 3S with Hand #2, and 3H
        (or perhaps 2NT) with Hands #3 and #4. But what do these rebids mean to
        responder? Do they show suit length, honor locations, overall high-card
        strength? Do they give partner enough information to make an intelligent
        decision about where the hand should be played?</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Because a jump-shift uses up so
        much bidding room, your partnership needs to have clear agreements about the
        meanings of subsequent bids. There are many different approaches -- the only
        important requirement is that you and your partner discuss the auctions in
        advance so you're ready when they come up at the table. To start your
        discussion, you may want to consider the suggestions here, which include some
        of the most valuable and widely used agreements:</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Opener's rebids</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">In choosing your rebid as opener,
        the main points to remember are:</font>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">The jump-shifter promises at
            least 5 cards in his suit and good honor strength (at least two of the top
            three honors).</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Partner's jump-shift shows at
            least a slam invitation, but he doesn't necessarily promise 19 high-card
            points. He may be basing his evaluation on playing strength and, with some
            types of hands, can have as few as 13-16 high-card points (see the
            discussion below on responder's rebids).</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Partner will never jump-shift
            with a two- or three-suited hand (unless his second suit is <b><i>your</i></b>
            suit). For this reason, it's often a waste of bidding room for opener to
            show new 4-card suits after a jump-shift. Instead, it's more important to
            tell responder about the location of your hand's honor strength,
            especially for his suit.</font>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Here's a recommended set of
        agreements for opener's rebids after responder's jump-shift:</font>

          <font size="2"><b>A</b> <b>raise</b> <b>of</b>
            <b>responder's</b> <b>suit</b> promises one of the top three honors and at
            least doubleton support (Qx or better, although some players advocate
            raising with even a singleton honor). With Hand #1, raise to 3S -- partner
            will be more interested in your filler for his suit than in your club
            length.
          </font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b>

            you can't raise to 3S immediately because it promises a top honor.
            Instead, rebid 3D to describe your strong suit, then show your spade
            length with your next bid.</font>

      <font size="2">Opener's rebid may give you a
        clear idea of how to continue, especially if he raises your suit. On many
        hands, though, you'll need to find a rebid that further describes your hand or
        elicits more information from partner. Here are some recommendations for
        defining the jump-shifter's second bid:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">

        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A 2NT or 3NT rebid </b>shows
            a balanced slam <b><i>invitation</i></b> (17 to a &quot;bad&quot; 19) with
            a strong 5-card suit (at least two of the top three honors).</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A jump to 4 of your
              major-suit jump-shift </b>(1C by partner - 2S by you - 2NT - <b>4S</b>)
            shows a long, <b>solid</b> suit with intermediate high-card strength
            (13-16 pts.) and good controls.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A simple rebid of your
              jump-shift suit </b>(1C-2S-3C-<b>3S</b>) shows a long, <b>solid</b> suit
            with more high-card strength than the jump to four.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A rebid of partner's suit</b>
            (1C-2S-2NT-<b>3C</b>) promises support -- 4+-card length if the opening
            bid was a minor, 3-card length if it was a major. It also tends to deny an
            outside singleton.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A new suit </b>(1C-2S-2NT-<b>3D</b>)
            shows support for partner and a singleton in the suit bid.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Using these guidelines, here's how
        you would rebid the various types of hands with which you would make an
        initial jump-shift:</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">A strong hand (17+ pts.) with ONE
        good suit.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">A jump-shift is often the best way
        to find out whether partner can fill in your long, almost-solid suit (a 6+
        card suit missing only one of the top three honors). With Hand #5, a grand
        slam (or even a small) probably depends on partner holding the diamond king.
        Since it's unlikely partner will be able to raise a 1D response, the best way
        to find out about his support is to set the suit by jump-shifting to 2D. If
        partner has at least Kx, he'll raise to 3D. You can then Blackwood and bid the
        laydown 7NT if partner shows two aces and another king. If partner doesn't
        raise diamonds, you can still Blackwood to find out about a possible singleton
        king.</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">An intermediate hand (13-16 pts.)
        with a solid suit.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Many players favor using a
        jump-shift followed by a jump to game in that suit to show solid trumps with
        good outside controls, but not enough to make a five-level slam try. A good
        rule to follow is not to have two quick losers in an unbid suit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">With Hand #6, jump to 2H, then
        rebid 4H. Partner will know not to worry about trumps. He'll bid on with good
        quick tricks (a hand like&nbsp;<img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">A765&nbsp;<img alt="H-"
          src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">6&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K92&nbsp;<img
          alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">AK954),
        but pass with softer values (<img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ7&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif"
          width="13" height="11">654&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ&nbsp;<img alt="C-"
          src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ853).
        Note that 5H may be too high with the second hand.</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">A balanced slam invitation (17 to
        a &quot;bad&quot; 19 pts.) with a good 5-card suit.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">With Hand #7, jump-shift to 2S,
        then rebid 3NT. This gives partner a near-perfect description of your
        point-count, balanced strength and source of tricks. For the best results,
        this jump-shift sequence should only be used with slam <b>invitational </b>hands.
        With stronger, insist-on-slam hands, you may have a hard time coming up with a
        good rebid after your jump-shift, so start with a low-level response instead.</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">A slam-try or better hand (16+
        pts.) with a good suit AND length in partner's suit.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">With Hand #8, start with a
        jump-shift to 2S, then raise partner's club suit. This auction shows your good
        support and outside source of tricks and helps partner evaluate his hand.
        He'll be encouraged to cooperate with your slam try when he holds the
        &quot;right&quot; minimum (<img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">54&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif"

          src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ932).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">You can also use any new-suit
        rebid to show support for partner. Many experts advocate using this bid to
        identify a singleton. With Hand #9, the auction might go 1C by partner - 2H by
        you - 2S/2NT/3C - 3D. Your 3D can't be natural (since you wouldn't have
        jump-shifted with length in two unbid suits). Instead, it shows your singleton
        diamond and 4+-card club support, which may help you get to a short-point
        slam.</font>

        of a &quot;fit-showing jump-shift&quot;. Some panelists admitted that they had
        this treatment written on their convention cards, but had never discussed the
        exact requirements with their partners. One panelist thought the best hand

      <font size="2">So what exactly is a fit-showing
        jump-shift, and what should it show? Does it promise 3-card or 4-card support,
        an outside ace, a singleton? How good should the jump-shift suit be? Here's a
        review of expert opinion and some guidelines on how you can add this valuable
        bid to your system:</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Why use fit-showing jump-shifts?</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Old-time Standard American defined
        a passed-hand jump-shift as &quot;good hand, good suit&quot;. If partner
        opened 1C in third or fourth seat, a jump to 2S showed a hand like&nbsp;<img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13"
          height="11">KQJ87&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A82&nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif"
          width="13" height="11">J74&nbsp;<img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">92.
        In practice, though, a simple 1S is better with this type of scattered
        strength. If partner has opened light and passes, you're probably high enough
        -- and you certainly aren't missing a game. If partner has a full opener,
        he'll bid again and you can make a game try.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">For these reasons, today's experts
        recommend that a passed-hand jump-shift be reserved for a special type of hand
        -- one that has been revalued upwards because of partner's opening bid. Since
        the jump takes you to a higher level than partner may have planned, it's
        important to have the safety of a known fit. Some players use the passed-hand
        jump-shift as a mini-splinter, but a more popular treatment is the natural,
        &quot;fit-showing&quot; jump-shift used in the problem above.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">What does the jump show?</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">To add this bid to your system,
        you and your partner need to agree on some basic criteria.<b><i> In general,</i></b>
        a passed-hand jump-shift should meet four requirements:</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">(1) A good 5+-card suit.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The honor strength you promise in
        your suit may depend on whether partner's opening bid was a major or a minor.
        Keep in mind that if partner opens a minor and you jump in a major, you're
        suggesting a new trump suit -- if your hand meets the other guidelines, your
        major can be any &quot;decent&quot; 5+-cards (KJxxx, AJxxx, even QJ10xx). But
        if partner opens a major, your jump confirms <b><i>his</i></b> suit as trumps
        and shows an outside source of <b><i>tricks</i></b>. You may want to agree
        that after a major opening, responder promises two of the top three honors in
        his jump-shift suit.</font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">(2) 4+-card support for opener's
        suit.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This is an absolute requirement if
        partner opened a minor. If he's opened a major, some partnerships agree that
        you may occasionally have <b><i>good</i></b> 3-card support. You can discuss
        whether or not you want to bid 3D over 1S with a hand like<br>
        <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ6&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13"

          width="13" height="11">6543.
        If you play the Drury convention (which shows support and asks partner how
        good his hand is), a 2C bid with this hand may work better.
      </font>
    <h4 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">(3) Maximum high-card points.</font>
    </h4>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">&quot;Maximum&quot; is usually
        10-11 HCPs, but can be fewer, especially after a major opening. You may
        jump-shift with 8-9 HCPs if your honors are &quot;prime&quot; and concentrated
        in your two suits.</font>
    <ul>

            useful if you play it as forcing, suggesting a slam and asking for a
            cuebid. Since responder has already invited game with his jump, there's
            little value in using this raise as a re-invitation by opener.</font>

            For most slam-try hands, though, consider using the notrump asking bid
            described below.</font>

        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>A minimum notrump bid </b>(1C-2S-<b>2NT</b>
            or 1S-3D-<b>3NT</b>) can be used to ask partner for his singleton, which
            can be helpful for both game and slam decisions. Suppose you open 1D with&nbsp;<img alt="S-" src="s.gif"
              width="13" height="11">Q4&nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AKJ&nbsp;<img alt="D-"

            and your passed-hand partner jumps to 2S. Over your 2NT, if he bids 3H
            (his singleton), you'll know 3NT is the best contract. If he bids 3C, you
            can forget notrump and try 3S to show your modest support.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">This notrump bid can also improve
        the accuracy of your slam bidding. If partner bids 3C over your 1S opening
        bid, you can rebid 3NT (asking for his singleton) with&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13"

        system described here, there's no longer any guessing about slam
        possibilities. The vote should now be unanimous for 3NT -- if partner can show
        the singleton club we're hoping for, we can Blackwood to check on the heart
