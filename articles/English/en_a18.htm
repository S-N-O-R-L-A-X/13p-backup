        and Cashing Tricks</font>
    </h2>
    <hr width="100%">
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Your first step as declarer is
        deciding on an overall plan for making your contract (see the declarer-play
        lesson on&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">Forming a Plan</font>).&nbsp; To develop
        and carry out that plan, you need some basic knowledge about the different
        techniques that can be used to establish tricks.&nbsp; One play you'll need to
        use frequently is the <b><i>finesse</i></b>, which involves trapping the
        opponents' honors (see the lesson on <font color="#0000FF">The Finesse</font>).&nbsp;
        Other techniques include building your natural honor tricks and setting up
        your long suits. Here's a basic overview of these declarer-play techniques and
        some tips on how to cash the tricks you set up:</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Building Natural Tricks</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">One of your main sources of tricks
        is in suits where you have honors. Some holdings -- aces, or AK and AKQ
        combinations -- provide sure tricks that can be cashed without giving up the
        lead. On most hands, though, you'll also need tricks from suits that <b><i>don't</i></b>
        have all the top honors. To turn these suits' potential tricks into sure
        tricks, you have to do some work.</font>
    <dl>
      <dt style="line-height: 100%">
        <font size="2">One of the most common ways to
          build tricks through power is to drive out the opponents' aces and kings
          (and sometimes queens). When you form your plan, identify which honor
          combinations and suits offer the greatest number of potential tricks.
          Decide how and when you'll lead these suits, and don't be afraid to lose
          the lead. Here are some simple examples:</font>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="line-height: 100%">
              <font size="2"><b>KQJ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  432</b> -- This combination is one loser and two winners. To actually
                cash your two tricks, though, you have to get the ace out of the way.
                The opponents won't usually be anxious to help. You'll have to lead this
                suit yourself and force them to take their ace.</font>
          <li>
            <p style="line-height: 100%">
              <font size="2"><b>J10984&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  7653</b> -- This suit has at least two potential winners, but to score
                them, you must be willing to give up the lead three times. Note that
                you'll win <b><i>three</i></b> tricks if the missing cards divide 2-2.</font>
          </li>
        </ul>

    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Developing Long-Suit Winners</font>
    </h3>
    <dl>
      <dt style="line-height: 100%">
        <font size="2">Another way to establish tricks
          is by setting up your long suits. Small cards in a long suit will often
          become winners when the opponents have no more cards in that suit. The
          chance that a long suit will provide extra winners will often depend on
          how the opponents' cards are divided. For example:</font>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="line-height: 100%">
              <font size="2"><b>AKQ32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  654</b> -- This suit will provide five tricks if all the opponents'
                cards drop under the AKQ. The missing cards must be divided 3-2 for you
                to win five tricks. What if the cards divide 4-1? If this is a side suit
                in a trump contract, you can trump the 2 to draw the last outstanding
                card and make your 3 a winner. If you're in notrump, you may want to
                give the opponents the fourth trick so you can win the fifth.</font>
          <li>
            <p style="line-height: 100%">
              <font size="2"><b>AK876&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  54</b> -- In notrump, this suit can provide three or four tricks, but
                only if you let the opponents win a trick or two. If the missing cards
                break 3-3, you can cash AK and lead the 6, letting the opponents win the
                trick. This will establish dummy's 87 for two more tricks. If the
                missing cards instead break 4-2, you'll have to lose two tricks to
                establish the 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is a side suit in a trump
                contract, you may be able to set up three or four tricks without losing
                any. Cash the ace-king, then trump dummy's 6. If the suit divides 3-3,
                you've created two more tricks. If the suit divides 4-2, you'll have to
                trump <b><i>two</i></b> of dummy's small cards to set up the third.</font>
          </li>
        </ul>
    </dl>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">When you try to count winners in a
        long suit, you won't always know exactly how many tricks it will provide. You
        can make a good guess, though, if you know how the missing cards are <b><i>likely</i></b>
        to divide in the opponents' hands. See <font color="#0000FF">Declarer Play:
          Simple Odds</font> for a summary of the probabilities of various suit breaks.&nbsp;</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">When leading long suits, be sure
        you count the opponents' cards as they play to each trick. You'll need to keep
        track of how many cards are outstanding to determine whether or not your cards
        are winners.&nbsp; For tips on how to count cards, see <font color="#0000FF">Developing
          Your Counting Skills</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

      <font size="2">Unblocking plays</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">With some combinations, you must
        plan your plays so that once you establish your suit, the lead will be in the
        correct hand. The order of your leads can be critical if one hand has more
        cards in the suit than the other. Whether you're building natural honor tricks
        or trying to establish a long suit, you will often need to plan to <b><i>unblock</i></b>
        the suit to be sure you can cash all the tricks you set up.</font>
    <dl>
      <dt style="line-height: 100%">
        <font size="2">If you're leading a suit that's
          <b><i>unevenly divided</i></b> between your hand and dummy's, <b>play the
            high cards from the short suit first</b>. Stated another way, plan your
          leads so the hand with the long suit is winning the trick when you are
          playing the last card from the hand with the short suit. Here are some
          examples:
        </font>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="line-height: 100%">
              <font size="2"><b>QJ102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  K3&nbsp; -- </b>With this combination, you'll have three winners after
                you force out the ace. Attack this suit by playing the king on the first
                trick (high card from the short suit). Now you can lead the 3 over to
                the QJ10 and continue leading the suit.</font>
          <li>
            <p style="line-height: 100%">
              <font size="2"><b>AKJ32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                  Q4&nbsp; </b>-- You should also unblock when you're cashing sure tricks.
                Here, win the first trick with the queen, then lead the 4 over to the
                AKJ3. If you instead lead the ace first, then low to the queen, the suit
                is blocked -- you'll have three good tricks left in the long suit, but
                no easy way to get to them.</font>
