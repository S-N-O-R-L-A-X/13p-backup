  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Declarer Play II -- Establishing 
  and Cashing Tricks</font></h2>
  <hr width="100%">
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your first step as declarer is 
  deciding on an overall plan for making your contract (see the declarer-play 
  lesson on&nbsp; <font color="#0000FF">Forming a Plan</font>).&nbsp; To develop 
  and carry out that plan, you need some basic knowledge about the different 
  techniques that can be used to establish tricks.&nbsp; One play you'll need to 
  use frequently is the <b><i>finesse</i></b>, which involves trapping the 
  opponents' honors (see the lesson on <font color="#0000FF">The Finesse</font>).&nbsp; 
  Other techniques include building your natural honor tricks and setting up 
  your long suits. Here's a basic overview of these declarer-play techniques and 
  some tips on how to cash the tricks you set up:</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Building Natural Tricks</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One of your main sources of tricks 
  is in suits where you have honors. Some holdings -- aces, or AK and AKQ 
  combinations -- provide sure tricks that can be cashed without giving up the 
  lead. On most hands, though, you'll also need tricks from suits that <b><i>don't</i></b> 
  have all the top honors. To turn these suits' potential tricks into sure 
  tricks, you have to do some work.</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One of the most common ways to 
      build tricks through power is to drive out the opponents' aces and kings 
      (and sometimes queens). When you form your plan, identify which honor 
      combinations and suits offer the greatest number of potential tricks. 
      Decide how and when you'll lead these suits, and don't be afraid to lose 
      the lead. Here are some simple examples:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>KQJ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        432</b> -- This combination is one loser and two winners. To actually 
        cash your two tricks, though, you have to get the ace out of the way. 
        The opponents won't usually be anxious to help. You'll have to lead this 
        suit yourself and force them to take their ace.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>J10984&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        7653</b> -- This suit has at least two potential winners, but to score 
        them, you must be willing to give up the lead three times. Note that 
        you'll win <b><i>three</i></b> tricks if the missing cards divide 2-2.</font></li>
    </ul>
  </dl>
  <hr width="100%">
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Developing Long-Suit Winners</font></h3>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Another way to establish tricks 
      is by setting up your long suits. Small cards in a long suit will often 
      become winners when the opponents have no more cards in that suit. The 
      chance that a long suit will provide extra winners will often depend on 
      how the opponents' cards are divided. For example:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>AKQ32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        654</b> -- This suit will provide five tricks if all the opponents' 
        cards drop under the AKQ. The missing cards must be divided 3-2 for you 
        to win five tricks. What if the cards divide 4-1? If this is a side suit 
        in a trump contract, you can trump the 2 to draw the last outstanding 
        card and make your 3 a winner. If you're in notrump, you may want to 
        give the opponents the fourth trick so you can win the fifth.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>AK876&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        54</b> -- In notrump, this suit can provide three or four tricks, but 
        only if you let the opponents win a trick or two. If the missing cards 
        break 3-3, you can cash AK and lead the 6, letting the opponents win the 
        trick. This will establish dummy's 87 for two more tricks. If the 
        missing cards instead break 4-2, you'll have to lose two tricks to 
        establish the 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is a side suit in a trump 
        contract, you may be able to set up three or four tricks without losing 
        any. Cash the ace-king, then trump dummy's 6. If the suit divides 3-3, 
        you've created two more tricks. If the suit divides 4-2, you'll have to 
        trump <b><i>two</i></b> of dummy's small cards to set up the third.</font></li>
    </ul>
  </dl>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When you try to count winners in a 
  long suit, you won't always know exactly how many tricks it will provide. You 
  can make a good guess, though, if you know how the missing cards are <b><i>likely</i></b> 
  to divide in the opponents' hands. See <font color="#0000FF">Declarer Play: 
  Simple Odds</font> for a summary of the probabilities of various suit breaks.&nbsp;</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When leading long suits, be sure 
  you count the opponents' cards as they play to each trick. You'll need to keep 
  track of how many cards are outstanding to determine whether or not your cards 
  are winners.&nbsp; For tips on how to count cards, see <font color="#0000FF">Developing 
  Your Counting Skills</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  </font></p>
  <hr width="100%">
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Unblocking plays</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With some combinations, you must 
  plan your plays so that once you establish your suit, the lead will be in the 
  correct hand. The order of your leads can be critical if one hand has more 
  cards in the suit than the other. Whether you're building natural honor tricks 
  or trying to establish a long suit, you will often need to plan to <b><i>unblock</i></b> 
  the suit to be sure you can cash all the tricks you set up.</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you're leading a suit that's 
      <b><i>unevenly divided</i></b> between your hand and dummy's, <b>play the 
      high cards from the short suit first</b>. Stated another way, plan your 
      leads so the hand with the long suit is winning the trick when you are 
      playing the last card from the hand with the short suit. Here are some 
      examples:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>QJ102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        K3&nbsp; -- </b>With this combination, you'll have three winners after 
        you force out the ace. Attack this suit by playing the king on the first 
        trick (high card from the short suit). Now you can lead the 3 over to 
        the QJ10 and continue leading the suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>AKJ32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Q4&nbsp; </b>-- You should also unblock when you're cashing sure tricks. 
        Here, win the first trick with the queen, then lead the 4 over to the 
        AKJ3. If you instead lead the ace first, then low to the queen, the suit 
        is blocked -- you'll have three good tricks left in the long suit, but 
        no easy way to get to them.</font></li>
    </ul>
