  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">The Reverse by Opener</font></h2>
  <hr align="left">
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Basic bridge bidding is based on a 
  practice called &quot;up-the-line&quot;, which means that after you open, 
  partner's one-level responses and your rebids are always made in the <b><i>cheapest</i></b> 
  of your 4-card suits. For example, if you open 1C and partner has two 4-card 
  majors, he'll always bid 1H to keep the bidding low and give you room to show 
  a possible 4-card spade suit. This assures that you'll find any major-suit 
  fit, and that you'll keep the bidding low until you've exchanged complete 
  information about your suit lengths. (See the lesson on <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Which 
  Suit to Respond?&quot;</font> .)</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If partner bypasses a suit he 
  could have shown at the one-level, you should always assume (at least 
  temporarily) that he does <b><i>not</i></b> have 4-card length in that suit. <b><i>For 
  example:</i></b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You open 1D with&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11"><b>94&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">KQ103&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">AJ764&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">K10&nbsp; 
  </b>and partner responds 1S. With your minimum opening, it's pointless to bid 
  2H (a suit partner has denied), which could force the bidding to the 3-level. 
  You should rebid 1NT with this hand to show your minimum point-count and keep 
  the auction low. It's possible that partner has 5 spades and 4 hearts, but in 
  that case, he'll bid 2H over your 1NT rebid.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When you have a stronger hand, 
  though -- such as&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11"><b>4&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">KQ103&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">AKJ76&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">A102 
  -- </b>you can afford to take the bidding higher. To show extra strength, you 
  can make a <b><i>reverse, </i></b>which is a<b><i> </i></b>bid of a suit 
  partner has bypassed (in the above example, your rebid of 2H would be a 
  reverse). Put another way, it's a bid that will force partner to bid at the 
  3-level if he prefers your first suit.&nbsp; Some typical reverse auctions 
  are:</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><u>Opener&nbsp; Responder</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Opener&nbsp; 
  Responder</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Opener&nbsp; Responder</u></b><br>
  1C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  1H&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1NT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  1S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2D<br>
  2D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  2S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  3C</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A two-level reverse</b>&nbsp; 
  (where you must go to the 2-level to show your second suit) shows a 
  distributional hand with extra strength, and it forces partner to bid again. 
  Specifically, it promises: <b>1 - </b>At least 16-17+ high-card pts.; <b>2 - </b>At 
  least 5-4 distribution in your two suits; <b>3 -</b> Your first suit must be 
  longer than your second suit; <b>4 -</b> Your second suit must be <b><i>higher 
  in rank </i></b>than your first suit; <b><i>and</i></b> <b>5 - </b>Partner 
  must have bypassed your second suit with his response. Opener's one-level 
  rebid (1C-1H-<b>1S</b>) is <b><i>not</i></b> a reverse. Your rebid is a 
  reverse <b><i>only</i></b> if you must go to a higher level to show the suit 
  (1C-1NT-<b>2S</b>).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>A</b> <b>three-level reverse</b>&nbsp; 
  is made when partner's response forces you to the 3-level to show your second 
  suit. Like a two-level reverse, this is forcing and shows extra values. The 
  only differences are that your second suit will usually be<br>
  <b>lower in rank</b> than your first suit, and you may have equal length in 
  your two suits.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><i><font size="2">Here are some typical hands:</font></i></b>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img src="s.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11"><b>J107&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">3&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">AQJ7&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">AKQ102 
  -- </b>You open 1C and partner responds 1S. You can now reverse with a rebid 
  of 2D. This forces partner to bid again and give you more information. If he 
  rebids a long spade suit, you'll raise to 4S. If he bids anything else, you 
  can further describe your hand by bidding spades next. Note that since you 
  didn't raise spades right away, you denied holding 4-card support. Your 
  belated raise shows 3-card spade support <b><i>and</i></b> , by inference, 
  tells partner you have a singleton heart (since you've shown 9 cards in clubs 
  and diamonds and 3 cards in spades).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img src="s.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11"><b>AQJ106&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">J&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">KQ1076&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">A5 
  -- </b>You open 1S and partner bids 2H, showing 10+ pts. and at least 5 
  hearts. Since you must go to the next highest level to show your diamond suit, 
  a 3D bid here is a <b>3-level reverse</b> (often called a <b><i>high-level 
  reverse</i></b>). With a weaker hand (12-14 pts.), you would rebid 2S to show 
  a minimum and keep the bidding low.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img src="s.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11"><b>AK1054&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">KQ9862&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">A4&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">Void 
  --&nbsp;</b> You can also use a reverse bid when your suits are longer than 
  5-4.&nbsp; Here, you open 1H, partner responds 1NT, and you make a reverse bid 
  of 2S to force. Over whatever partner bids, you'll bid your spades again to 
  show extra length. Partner will know that you must hold 5 spades (because you 
  bid them twice) and 6 hearts (because your hearts must be longer than your 
  spades). Partner can now decide what the trump suit should be.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><img src="s.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11"><b>K9&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">AQ72&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">AQ&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13" height="11">KJ754 
  -- </b>You open&nbsp; 1C and partner bids 1S. This hand qualifies as a reverse 
  to 2H, but a 2NT rebid is a better description of your strength and 
  distribution. Your hand is fairly balanced, your suits are not robust, and you 
  have almost half your points in your doubletons. If you instead bid 2H here, 
  you promise only about 17+ pts., and you tend to show a hand that's more 
  suitable for a trump contract than for 3NT.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Responding to a reverse</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Opener's reverse&nbsp; is forcing 
  for one round -- you must bid again, even if you have a very weak response. In 
  general, you should base your rebid on your picture of partner's hand (he's 
  shown at least 5-4 in his suits) and try to support one of his suits if 
  possible. Here are some simple meanings for your second bid, in the general 
  order of preference you should consider them:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Raise of partner's second 
      suit</b> (1C-1S-2H-<b>3H</b>) = 4-card support</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Bid of partner's first suit</b> 
      (1C-1S-2H-<b>3C</b>) = 3+-card support</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Jump in partner's first 
      suit</b> (1C-1S-2H-<b>4C</b>) = a strong, distributional hand with 4-5 
      cards in partner's suit and slam values (12+ playing pts.)</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Rebid of your own long suit 
      </b>(1C-1S-2H-<b>2S</b>) = very weak hand (5-7 pts.) with 5+ (preferably 
      6) cards in your suit and no fit for partner's suits.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>2NT</b> = weak response 
      (5-7 pts.) with a stopper in the unbid suit.&nbsp; You can also choose to 
      use 2NT here as the <font color="#0000FF">Lebensohl 2NT Convention</font> 
      (see below).</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>3NT</b> = good values (8-11 
      pts.) with stoppers in the unbid suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>The unbid suit</b> 
      (1C-1S-2H-<b>3D</b>) = forcing and could be artificial, usually without 
      support for partner's suits. Like &quot;New Minor Forcing&quot;, a bid of 
      the fourth suit can be used when you have a good hand (8+ pts.) and want 
      to find out if opener has 3-card support for your major.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><i>If you'd like a more 
  accurate way to rebid after a reverse, </i></b>you can use a popular 
  convention called the Lebensohl 2NT.&nbsp; See the lesson on <font color="#0000FF">Lebensohl 
  over Reverses</font> on this site.</font>
