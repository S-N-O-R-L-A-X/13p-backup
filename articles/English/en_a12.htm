      <font size="4">The Reverse by Opener</font>
    </h2>
    <hr align="left">
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Basic bridge bidding is based on a
        practice called &quot;up-the-line&quot;, which means that after you open,
        partner's one-level responses and your rebids are always made in the <b><i>cheapest</i></b>
        of your 4-card suits. For example, if you open 1C and partner has two 4-card
        majors, he'll always bid 1H to keep the bidding low and give you room to show
        a possible 4-card spade suit. This assures that you'll find any major-suit
        fit, and that you'll keep the bidding low until you've exchanged complete
        information about your suit lengths. (See the lesson on <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Which
          Suit to Respond?&quot;</font> .)</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If partner bypasses a suit he
        could have shown at the one-level, you should always assume (at least
        temporarily) that he does <b><i>not</i></b> have 4-card length in that suit. <b><i>For
            example:</i></b><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You open 1D with&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13"
          height="11"><b>94&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="h.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13"
            height="11">KQ103&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="d.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13"
            height="11">AJ764&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="c.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13"
            height="11">K10&nbsp;
        </b>and partner responds 1S. With your minimum opening, it's pointless to bid
        2H (a suit partner has denied), which could force the bidding to the 3-level.
        You should rebid 1NT with this hand to show your minimum point-count and keep
        the auction low. It's possible that partner has 5 spades and 4 hearts, but in
        that case, he'll bid 2H over your 1NT rebid.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">When you have a stronger hand,
        though -- such as&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="s.gif" border="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" width="13"

          -- </b>you can afford to take the bidding higher. To show extra strength, you
        can make a <b><i>reverse, </i></b>which is a<b><i> </i></b>bid of a suit
        partner has bypassed (in the above example, your rebid of 2H would be a
        reverse). Put another way, it's a bid that will force partner to bid at the
        3-level if he prefers your first suit.&nbsp; Some typical reverse auctions
        are:</font>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>A two-level reverse</b>&nbsp;
        (where you must go to the 2-level to show your second suit) shows a
        distributional hand with extra strength, and it forces partner to bid again.
        Specifically, it promises: <b>1 - </b>At least 16-17+ high-card pts.; <b>2 - </b>At
        least 5-4 distribution in your two suits; <b>3 -</b> Your first suit must be
        longer than your second suit; <b>4 -</b> Your second suit must be <b><i>higher
            in rank </i></b>than your first suit; <b><i>and</i></b> <b>5 - </b>Partner
        must have bypassed your second suit with his response. Opener's one-level
        rebid (1C-1H-<b>1S</b>) is <b><i>not</i></b> a reverse. Your rebid is a
        reverse <b><i>only</i></b> if you must go to a higher level to show the suit
        (1C-1NT-<b>2S</b>).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>A</b> <b>three-level reverse</b>&nbsp;
        is made when partner's response forces you to the 3-level to show your second
        suit. Like a two-level reverse, this is forcing and shows extra values. The
        only differences are that your second suit will usually be<br>
        <b>lower in rank</b> than your first suit, and you may have equal length in
        your two suits.

          -- </b>You open 1C and partner responds 1S. You can now reverse with a rebid
        of 2D. This forces partner to bid again and give you more information. If he
        rebids a long spade suit, you'll raise to 4S. If he bids anything else, you
        can further describe your hand by bidding spades next. Note that since you
        didn't raise spades right away, you denied holding 4-card support. Your
        belated raise shows 3-card spade support <b><i>and</i></b> , by inference,
        tells partner you have a singleton heart (since you've shown 9 cards in clubs
        and diamonds and 3 cards in spades).</font>

        a 3D bid here is a <b>3-level reverse</b> (often called a <b><i>high-level
            reverse</i></b>). With a weaker hand (12-14 pts.), you would rebid 2S to show

        show extra length. Partner will know that you must hold 5 spades (because you
        bid them twice) and 6 hearts (because your hearts must be longer than your
        spades). Partner can now decide what the trump suit should be.</font>

        to 2H, but a 2NT rebid is a better description of your strength and
        distribution. Your hand is fairly balanced, your suits are not robust, and you
        have almost half your points in your doubletons. If you instead bid 2H here,
        you promise only about 17+ pts., and you tend to show a hand that's more
        suitable for a trump contract than for 3NT.</font>

        for one round -- you must bid again, even if you have a very weak response. In
        general, you should base your rebid on your picture of partner's hand (he's
        shown at least 5-4 in his suits) and try to support one of his suits if
        possible. Here are some simple meanings for your second bid, in the general
