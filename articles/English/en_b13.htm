    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The DONT convention (&quot;Disturb
        the Opponents' Notrump) is used in the direct or balancing seat after an
        opponent opens a strong notrump (14+ HCPs). It can also be used over 2NT
        openers.</font>

        overcall):</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><strong>Double </strong>relays
        partner to 2C to let the doubler show his suit. The doubler can then pass (if
        his suit was clubs) or bid 2D, 2H or 2S. If the doubler holds a strong hand
        with game interest, he can jump to 3 of his suit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Bergen warns that the since the
        doubler could be light in high cards, partner should &quot;never&quot; leave
        the double in. However, partner is not forced to take the 2C relay if he has
        his own suit (a 6-card suit or good 5-carder), especially when he holds
        extreme shortness in one of the unbid suits. One of the examples Bergen gives
        is &nbsp; <b><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">Jxxx &nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13"
            height="11">x
          &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KQJ10x &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13"
            height="11">xxx
        </b>. Instead of taking the relay to 2C (over which partner will most likely
        bid 2H), he would bid 2D over partner's double.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">After the overcaller shows his
        suit, partner can raise to show a fit. Raises of minors tend to be preemptive;
        raises of majors show a mild game invitation. To show a fit and a stronger
        game invitation, partner bids 2NT.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><strong>A 2S overcall</strong> is
        one of two ways to show a spade one-suiter (you can also double first, and
        then rebid 2S). To distinguish between the two sequences, you can adopt one of
        these sets of agreements (depending on your partnership preference:)</font>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">A direct 2S overcall shows
            minimum strength. Double-then-2S shows extra high-card values and more
            defense.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">A direct 2S overcall shows a
            &quot;true&quot; one-suiter with longer, stronger spades. Double-then-2S
            shows only a 5-card spade suit and/or a hand that may be suitable for play
            in other suits. Since the double gives responder room to show his own
            suit, the double-then-2S auction tends to show a more balanced hand.</font>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">　
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">

    <p style="line-height: 100%"><strong>
        <font size="2">After a 2C, 2D or 2H
          overcall, the meanings of partner's bids are:</font>
      </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><strong>Pass = </strong>He's
            content to play in the suit bid. He'll usually have shortness in one or
            more of the higher-ranking suits.</font>

          <font size="2"><strong>Bid of the next
              cheapest suit </strong>(i.e., 1NT - 2C - Pass - 2D) = He prefers to play
            in your other suit and wants you to bid it (or pass if his bid is your
            suit). Partner will usually have at least 3-card length in all
            higher-ranking suits. If partner asks for your other suit and then rebids
            2NT after you show it, it's a strong game invitation in your second suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><strong>Bid of a new suit that
              is <i>not</i> the cheapest suit</strong> (1NT - 2C - Pass - <strong>2H</strong>
            or <strong>2S</strong>) = Natural, showing his own 6-card suit or strong
            5-carder.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><strong>A raise of your
              minor-suit overcall or rebid</strong> tends to be preemptive.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><strong>A raise of your
              major-suit overcall or rebid</strong> is mildly invitational. 2NT shows
            the strong invitation.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><strong>2NT</strong> (rare) =
            A strong game invitation that asks you to bid your other suit at the
            3-level (or 4-level, if your second suit is a major and you are strong
            enough to accept the invitation). Partner will always have excellent
            support for all higher-ranking suits.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><strong>In general: </strong>If
        you're responder,<strong> </strong>assume that partner's second suit is
        probably the one where you have shortness, and remember that he may be only
        5-4 in his suits. If partner overcalls 2C and you hold &nbsp; <b><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13"
            height="11">Axxx

            height="11">Jxxx
          &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">Jxx</b>, you should
        opt for safety and pass in your known club fit. If you bid 2D to ask for his
        second suit, he'll probably bid 2H, which may be a 4-2 fit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">As Bergen notes, if partner
        overcalls 2D and you hold &nbsp; <b><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ10x

        &quot;dream on&quot; if you think his second suit might be spades. Bergen
        recommends bidding 3C with this hand.</font>

      <font size="2">Over opponents' interference</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If the 1NT opener's partner bids
        or doubles after your DONT overcall or double, your partner should never try
        to &quot;guess&quot; what your unnamed suit is. <strong>The only way to get
          the DONT bidder to show his unnamed suit is to double or redouble.</strong></font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">After your DONT two-suited
        overcall and an intervening bid by the opponent, the meanings of your

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><strong>Pass</strong> = He's

        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><strong>Redouble</strong>
            (over the opponent's double) = He prefers to play in your second suit and

        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><strong>Double (of a natural
              bid)</strong> = He wants you to bid your second suit. This double shows
            some high-card strength and tolerance for all unbid suits.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><strong>Double (of an
              artificial bid)</strong> = Lead directing. Some players forego the
            lead-directing definition and agree that a double of an artificial bid is
            the same as the double of a natural bid -- it shows values and encourages
            partner to bid his unnamed suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><strong>Any suit bid</strong>
