  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Bridge bidding -- DONT Convention 
  Summary</font></h2>
  <h4 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Introduced by Marty Bergen in <i><b>Bridge 
  Today</b></i> (Sept./Oct. 1989 issue; pp. 23-29)</font></h4>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The DONT convention (&quot;Disturb 
  the Opponents' Notrump) is used in the direct or balancing seat after an 
  opponent opens a strong notrump (14+ HCPs). It can also be used over 2NT 
  openers.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Overview of DONT actions</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Double</strong> = 
      Unspecified one-suiter; relays responder to 2C.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>2C, 2D, 2H</strong> = 
      Two-suiter (usually at least 5-4); shows the suit named plus a 
      higher-ranking suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>2S</strong> = Spade 
      one-suiter.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>2NT </strong>= 
      Major-minor two-suiter (6-5 or better), monster hand. (This relays partner 
      to 3C, over which opener identifies his two suits via a fairly complicated 
      code. See the original <i>Bridge Today</i> article for details on these 
      follow-up bids.)</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>3C, 3D, 3H, 3S</strong> 
      = Long suit (usually 7+ cards), preemptive.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>3NT</strong> = Major 
      two-suiter (6-5 or better), monster hand.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One-suited hands (Double or 2S 
  overcall):</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Double </strong>relays 
  partner to 2C to let the doubler show his suit. The doubler can then pass (if 
  his suit was clubs) or bid 2D, 2H or 2S. If the doubler holds a strong hand 
  with game interest, he can jump to 3 of his suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Bergen warns that the since the 
  doubler could be light in high cards, partner should &quot;never&quot; leave 
  the double in. However, partner is not forced to take the 2C relay if he has 
  his own suit (a 6-card suit or good 5-carder), especially when he holds 
  extreme shortness in one of the unbid suits. One of the examples Bergen gives 
  is &nbsp; <b><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">Jxxx &nbsp;<img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">x 
  &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KQJ10x &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">xxx 
  </b>. Instead of taking the relay to 2C (over which partner will most likely 
  bid 2H), he would bid 2D over partner's double.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After the overcaller shows his 
  suit, partner can raise to show a fit. Raises of minors tend to be preemptive; 
  raises of majors show a mild game invitation. To show a fit and a stronger 
  game invitation, partner bids 2NT.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>A 2S overcall</strong> is 
  one of two ways to show a spade one-suiter (you can also double first, and 
  then rebid 2S). To distinguish between the two sequences, you can adopt one of 
  these sets of agreements (depending on your partnership preference:)</font>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A direct 2S overcall shows 
      minimum strength. Double-then-2S shows extra high-card values and more 
      defense.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A direct 2S overcall shows a 
      &quot;true&quot; one-suiter with longer, stronger spades. Double-then-2S 
      shows only a 5-card spade suit and/or a hand that may be suitable for play 
      in other suits. Since the double gives responder room to show his own 
      suit, the double-then-2S auction tends to show a more balanced hand.</font></li>
  </ol>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Two-suited hands (2C, 2D, 2H, 2NT 
  or 3NT overcall):</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="2">After a 2C, 2D or 2H 
  overcall, the meanings of partner's bids are:</font></strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Pass = </strong>He's 
      content to play in the suit bid. He'll usually have shortness in one or 
      more of the higher-ranking suits.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Bid of the next 
      cheapest suit </strong>(i.e., 1NT - 2C - Pass - 2D) = He prefers to play 
      in your other suit and wants you to bid it (or pass if his bid is your 
      suit). Partner will usually have at least 3-card length in all 
      higher-ranking suits. If partner asks for your other suit and then rebids 
      2NT after you show it, it's a strong game invitation in your second suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Bid of a new suit that 
      is <i>not</i> the cheapest suit</strong> (1NT - 2C - Pass - <strong>2H</strong> 
      or <strong>2S</strong>) = Natural, showing his own 6-card suit or strong 
      5-carder.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>A raise of your 
      minor-suit overcall or rebid</strong> tends to be preemptive.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>A raise of your 
      major-suit overcall or rebid</strong> is mildly invitational. 2NT shows 
      the strong invitation.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>2NT</strong> (rare) = 
      A strong game invitation that asks you to bid your other suit at the 
      3-level (or 4-level, if your second suit is a major and you are strong 
      enough to accept the invitation). Partner will always have excellent 
      support for all higher-ranking suits.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>In general: </strong>If 
  you're responder,<strong> </strong>assume that partner's second suit is 
  probably the one where you have shortness, and remember that he may be only 
  5-4 in his suits. If partner overcalls 2C and you hold &nbsp; <b><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">Axxx 
  &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">xx &nbsp;<img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">Jxxx 
  &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">Jxx</b>, you should 
  opt for safety and pass in your known club fit. If you bid 2D to ask for his 
  second suit, he'll probably bid 2H, which may be a 4-2 fit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">As Bergen notes, if partner 
  overcalls 2D and you hold &nbsp; <b><img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ10x 
  &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">xx 
  &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">QJ109xx </b>, 
  &quot;dream on&quot; if you think his second suit might be spades. Bergen 
  recommends bidding 3C with this hand.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%">　
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Over opponents' interference</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If the 1NT opener's partner bids 
  or doubles after your DONT overcall or double, your partner should never try 
  to &quot;guess&quot; what your unnamed suit is. <strong>The only way to get 
  the DONT bidder to show his unnamed suit is to double or redouble.</strong></font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">After your DONT two-suited 
  overcall and an intervening bid by the opponent, the meanings of your 
  partner's bids are:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Pass</strong> = He's 
      content to play in the current contract.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Redouble</strong> 
      (over the opponent's double) = He prefers to play in your second suit and 
      wants you to bid it.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Double (of a natural 
      bid)</strong> = He wants you to bid your second suit. This double shows 
      some high-card strength and tolerance for all unbid suits.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Double (of an 
      artificial bid)</strong> = Lead directing. Some players forego the 
      lead-directing definition and agree that a double of an artificial bid is 
      the same as the double of a natural bid -- it shows values and encourages 
      partner to bid his unnamed suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Any suit bid</strong> 
      = Natural, showing his own long suit.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Defending against DONT overcalls 
  and doubles:</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you open 1NT and your opponent 
  makes a DONT bid or double, Bergen's system for partner's responses is:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Over any DONT overcall 
      or double:</strong> Texas transfers (if you normally play them) are 
      &quot;on&quot;.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Over a double</strong> 
      (one-suiter): Play &quot;front of the card&quot; (your normal response 
      system with Stayman, transfers, etc.)</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Over a 2C overcall:</strong> 
      Play &quot;front of the card&quot; (transfers, etc.), <strong><i>except</i></strong> 
      use double for Stayman.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Over a 2D or 2S 
      overcall:</strong> Treat either as a natural one-suiter. (Double is 
      penalty, Jacoby transfers are &quot;off&quot;, Lebensohl sequences are 
      &quot;on&quot;.)</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Over a 2H overcall</strong> 
      (major two-suiter):<br>
      </font>
      <ul>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Double</strong> = 
        &quot;Cards&quot; (around 8+ pts.) and at least 2 hearts.<br>
        <strong>2S</strong> = Minor-suit Stayman (weak or strong hand with both 
        minors).<br>
        <strong>2NT </strong>= Lebensohl (Relays opener to 3C; responder can 
        then sign off in a minor or show a good hand with stoppers).<br>
        <strong>3C </strong>or <strong>3D</strong> = Natural and invitational.<br>
        <strong>3H</strong> or <strong>3S</strong> = Singleton in that suit, 
        game-forcing.<br>
        <strong>3NT</strong> = To play, but with no major-suit stoppers.</font>
      </ul>
    </li>
