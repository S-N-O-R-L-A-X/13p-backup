    </h2>
    <hr>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">A balancing bid is made in the
        pass-out seat after an opponent has opened the bidding (1 of a suit on your
        left, Pass, Pass, to you). In these situations, it's often a good idea to
        stretch to keep the auction alive. To decide whether or not you should balance
        after a one-bid is passed around to you, keep these general guidelines in
        mind:</font>

        <font size="2">How strong is partner's
          hand?</font>
      </strong></h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">One reason for balancing is to
        protect partner when he has good values, but did not have a descriptive bid
        available in the direct seat. In some of these cases, he may have had a
        &quot;trap pass&quot;-a strong hand that could not call because of length in
        opener's suit. To get a general idea of partner's points and distribution when
        the opponents pass out a one-bid, you can usually assume that:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><i><b>On average,</b></i> your
            side will have about 20-22 pts. and the opponents will have 18-20 pts.
            (14-16 for opener, 4 for his partner). Subtract your HCP's from your
            side's 20-22 to determine partner's point-count.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2">Your side will have an average
            of 6 cards in opener's suit. Subtract the number of cards you have from 6
            to determine partner's length in that suit.<br>
          </font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Now<b> </b>look for other clues to
        determine how likely it is that partner's hand falls in the
        &quot;average&quot; ranges above. If you have a marginal balancing hand, use
        these guidelines to make your decision:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>If you have length in
              opener's suit, strongly consider passing.</b> Since you know partner is
            short in their suit, it's more likely he has a <i><b>weaker</b></i> hand
            (with shortness and strength, he could have made a takeout double or
            overcall).</font>
      </li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>If you're short in opener's
              suit, stretch to balance.</b> It's more likely partner has the <i><b>stronger</b></i>
            hand-his length in their suit may well be the reason he couldn't bid.</font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>

        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>If you're short in opener's
              suit, don't play partner for more than 15 pts.</b> With length in their
            suit, partner would have often bid 1NT if he had a 15+-point hand.</font>

        <p style="line-height: 100%">
          <font size="2"><b>Don't ever figure partner
              for more than 17 HCPs.</b> He won't usually &quot;trap&quot; with a hand
            this strong, so you don't need to protect him (or a possible game) with
            fewer than 8 pts.</font>

              and level of the opening bid.</b> If you're not vulnerable and the 1-level
            was available, partner could have overcalled if he had a long suit and 9+
            pts. Vulnerable (or if the opening bid would have forced him to the
            2-level), he will often pass with these minimum hands.</font>
