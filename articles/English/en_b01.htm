  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Balancing Over One-Bids</font></h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A balancing bid is made in the 
  pass-out seat after an opponent has opened the bidding (1 of a suit on your 
  left, Pass, Pass, to you). In these situations, it's often a good idea to 
  stretch to keep the auction alive. To decide whether or not you should balance 
  after a one-bid is passed around to you, keep these general guidelines in 
  mind:</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="2">The BEST time to 
      balance is when:</font></strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You're short in the 
        opponent's suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You have length and 
        high-card strength in the other three suits.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You have a good 5-card or 
        longer suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You're not vulnerable (if 
        you can't make your bid, the penalty will be lower, and may be even less 
        than the score you would have lost if you had defended the one-bid).</font></li>
    </ol>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="2">The WORST time to 
      balance is when:</font></strong>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You have a very weak hand 
        (fewer than 8 pts.) and/or a weak suit.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You<b> </b>have<b> </b>length<b> 
        </b>in<b> <i>OPENER'S </i></b>suit.<b> </b>The more cards you have in 
        the opponents' suit, the less chance there is that you and partner will 
        have a fit. It's often best to pass and let opener play in what may be a 
        bad contract.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You're vulnerable. If you 
        can't make your bid, the penalty may be expensive, so be conservative.</font></li>
    </ol>
  </dl>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="2">How strong is partner's 
  hand?</font></strong></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One reason for balancing is to 
  protect partner when he has good values, but did not have a descriptive bid 
  available in the direct seat. In some of these cases, he may have had a 
  &quot;trap pass&quot;-a strong hand that could not call because of length in 
  opener's suit. To get a general idea of partner's points and distribution when 
  the opponents pass out a one-bid, you can usually assume that:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><i><b>On average,</b></i> your 
      side will have about 20-22 pts. and the opponents will have 18-20 pts. 
      (14-16 for opener, 4 for his partner). Subtract your HCP's from your 
      side's 20-22 to determine partner's point-count.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your side will have an average 
      of 6 cards in opener's suit. Subtract the number of cards you have from 6 
      to determine partner's length in that suit.<br>
      </font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Now<b> </b>look for other clues to 
  determine how likely it is that partner's hand falls in the 
  &quot;average&quot; ranges above. If you have a marginal balancing hand, use 
  these guidelines to make your decision:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If you have length in 
      opener's suit, strongly consider passing.</b> Since you know partner is 
      short in their suit, it's more likely he has a <i><b>weaker</b></i> hand 
      (with shortness and strength, he could have made a takeout double or 
      overcall).</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If you're short in opener's 
      suit, stretch to balance.</b> It's more likely partner has the <i><b>stronger</b></i> 
      hand-his length in their suit may well be the reason he couldn't bid.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If you're short in opener's 
      suit, don't play partner for more than 15 pts.</b> With length in their 
      suit, partner would have often bid 1NT if he had a 15+-point hand.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Don't ever figure partner 
      for more than 17 HCPs.</b> He won't usually &quot;trap&quot; with a hand 
      this strong, so you don't need to protect him (or a possible game) with 
      fewer than 8 pts.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Consider the vulnerability 
      and level of the opening bid.</b> If you're not vulnerable and the 1-level 
      was available, partner could have overcalled if he had a long suit and 9+ 
      pts. Vulnerable (or if the opening bid would have forced him to the 
      2-level), he will often pass with these minimum hands.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Balancing after a Suit 
  Opening Bid</strong> (1C/1D/1H/1S - Pass - Pass - ?)</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When you balance over a one-bid, 
  you are, in effect, bidding some of partner's values for him. This means you 
  can &quot;shade down&quot; many of your bids. As a guideline, most of your 
  balancing bids promise about one King fewer than you would need to make the 
  same bid in the direct seat.</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Minimum suit bid </strong>(1D-Pass-Pass-<strong>1H) 
      = </strong>8-13 pts., usually a 5+-card suit (but may be a good 4-card 
      suit at the one-level). The better your suit, the fewer pts. you need to 
      bid.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>1NT </strong>(1D-Pass-Pass-<strong>1NT) 
      = </strong>About 11-14 pts. with stoppers (or moderate length) in the 
      opponent's suit. If you're vulnerable --&nbsp; and/or if the opening bid 
      was 1H or 1S -- raise the range to 13-15 (or a poor 16) pts.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>A jump in a new suit </strong>(1H-Pass-Pass-<strong>2S) 
      = </strong>13-16 pts. and a strong 6+-card suit. A jump in the balancing 
      seat <strong><i>invites</i></strong> game-it is <strong><i>not</i></strong> 
      a strong jump-shift or a preempt.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong>Double = </strong>for 
      takeout, showing 10+ pts. with shortness in the opponent's suit. A takeout 
      double can also be used to start the description of a better hand (14+ 
      pts.) that was too strong to balance with a simple suit bid or 1NT. After 
      partner responds to your double, you can show the stronger hand by 
      rebidding 1NT (to show 16-18 pts.) or freely bidding a new suit (to show 
      14+ pts. and a 5+-card suit).</font></li>

      meanings:<br>
      <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - </strong>A two-suited hand (the Michaels 
      convention); <strong>or</strong><br>
      <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - </strong>A strong, game-forcing takeout.</font></li>

  <b>seat</b> can be whatever you and partner agree -- a natural one-suited 
  hand, a conventional bid showing two suits, etc. Don't worry too much about

  strength when you balance.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Check the vulnerability.</b> 
  Since it's guaranteed that LHO has some length and defense against your suit 
  -- and his partner knows this -- you'll be doubled more often, so be sure you 
  have extra strength if you're vulnerable. If you're not vulnerable and the 
  opponents are, be more aggressive-you can balance with almost any hand that 
  has a long, decent suit.</font>

      weaker and pulls the double to his long suit, you have the safety of being
