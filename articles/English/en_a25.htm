  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Learning Bridge: 
  &quot;On-your-own&quot; activities to build your skills</font></h2>
  <hr width="100%">
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you've decided to take up the 
  game of bridge, you're about to discover the world's most popular and 
  challenging card game. You're also beginning a learning experience that can 
  truly last a lifetime, and any extra effort you can put into it now will make 
  it even more enjoyable in the years to come.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Whether you've chosen group 
  lessons, self-teaching and one-on-one instruction from a friend or relative, 
  you'll learn the game faster -- and enjoy it more -- if you take an active 
  role in your bridge education. It's difficult to become a good bridge player 
  if all you do is listen passively to your weekly lesson and hope it will 
  &quot;soak in&quot;. Instead, make a commitment do some outside homework and 
  practice. Try to devote at least a few minutes every day to some 
  bridge-related activity, and make your learning process a 
  &quot;multimedia&quot; one by taking advantage of lots of different resources. 
  Here are some suggestions for learning activities you can pursue on your own:</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Read, read, read</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you're taking a group class, 
  your instructor has probably given you a textbook or lesson handouts. Most 
  beginning bridge textbooks aren't intended to be light reading, so don't be 
  discouraged if you don't understand the material at first. Keep your book 
  handy (out on your desk, next to your favorite easychair) and plan to read and 
  study each chapter several times between classes.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You'll also benefit from 
  &quot;extra-curricular&quot; reading. There are dozens of good bridge books 
  written just for beginners, and you might be surprised to find that they're 
  entertaining as well as educational. When I learned to play, I read every book 
  I could get my hands on, but I found these three to be invaluable:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><i>Five Weeks to Winning 
    Bridge </i></b>by Alfred Sheinwold. This classic has taught millions to 
    play, and it's the very first bridge book I ever read. It's organized in 35 
    one-day lessons, but I read it in one weekend -- and then reread it several 
    times. Sheinwold uses a 4-card-major bidding system, but you can easily 
    adapt his principles to 5-card majors or any system.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><i>Classic Book on the Play 
    of the Hand</i></b> by Louis Watson. This is the oldest and most 
    comprehensive guide to understanding the cards, with a wealth of information 
    on suit combinations, basic strategies and other principles of declarer 
    play. You won't be able to read it in a weekend, or even a month, so plan to 
    take it slow and study each chapter carefully.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><i>Bid Better, Play Better</i></b> 
    by Dorothy Hayden (Truscott). One of the greatest bridge books of all time, 
    this book focuses on teaching you how to think like a bridge player. Much of 
    the material is aimed toward advanced beginners and intermediates, but even 
    learners will benefit from Hayden's clear approach and practical advice.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">There are a number of other 
  excellent books for beginners and learners. A listing of recommended titles -- 
  with short reviews and links for purchase from Amazon.com -- is available in 
  the <font color="#0000FF">Bridge Bookstore</font> on this site.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Read actively.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You may find it helpful to keep a 
  notebook and a deck of cards with your class textbook and any other bridge 
  books you're reading. Use the notebook to outline major points, create bidding 
  diagrams or jot down questions for your instructor. The deck of cards is a 
  great way to translate a textbook diagram into a &quot;real&quot; bridge hand. 
  Deal out the cards to match the example in the book and play it out on a 
  tabletop next to the open book. This exercise is especially beneficial if 
  you're studying suit combinations from a book like Watson's <i>Play of the 
  Hand</i>.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Play and learn on your computer.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">ACBL's&nbsp; <a href="http://www.acbl.org/notices/ltpb.stm" target="_blank">&quot;Learn 
  to Play Bridge&quot;</a> is a free program you can download and use to teach 
  yourself how to play. Its lessons emphasize card play, but you'll find a good 
  introduction to basic bidding here, too.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">There are also a wide range of 
  bid-and-play software packages that simulate a &quot;real&quot; game. Although 
  no program bids or plays like an expert, the programs are fun to play and they 
  can be great teaching resources. They give you the chance to practice bidding 
  and play -- with no time constraints, no limit to how often you can rebid and 
  replay a hand, and no worry about disappointing a human partner. Some programs 
  also have built-in lessons that you can use to teach yourself, even if you 
  know absolutely nothing about bridge when you start.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">There are many good bid-and-play 
  programs now on the market. My favorite is Bridge Baron (formerly called 
  Micro-Bridge Companion), which is available from bridge mail-order houses for 
  $59.95. A listing of software packages and links to the developers' websites 
  are in the <font color="#0000FF">Bridge software</font> list on this website.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Tune into bridge on TV.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Bridge instruction is also 
  available on TV in several entertaining, professionally produced series. Check 
  your PBS program listings to see if your local station is carrying one or more 
  of these programs. A summary of the available packages and tips for getting 
  your local station to run them are available at the <a href="http://www.acbl.org/~acbl/educate/teachers.htm#tv" target="_blank">American 
  Contract Bridge League website </a>.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Take advantage of Net resources.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You'll find a wealth of 
  instructional material on the web, ready to download or print. Many of these 
  sites present lessons in interesting formats, including interactive quizzes, 
  Javascript play and email lessons. You can find links to some of the best in 
  the <font color="#0000FF">Recommended websites for beginners</font> listing on 
  this site.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Develop your &quot;card 
  sense.&quot;</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Many people believe that an 
  aptitude for card games is an inborn trait -- you either have it, or you 
  don't. While this may be true to some extent, I believe that any motivated, 
  intelligent learner can develop these abilities. The article <font color="#0000FF">Developing 
  Your Card Sense</font> on this site will give you some suggestions for mental 
  exercises and other activities you can do to increase your facility with the 
  cards -- and be on your way to becoming a skilled bridge player.</font>
