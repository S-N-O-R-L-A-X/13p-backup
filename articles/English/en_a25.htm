        &quot;On-your-own&quot; activities to build your skills</font>
    </h2>
    <hr width="100%">
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If you've decided to take up the
        game of bridge, you're about to discover the world's most popular and
        challenging card game. You're also beginning a learning experience that can
        truly last a lifetime, and any extra effort you can put into it now will make
        it even more enjoyable in the years to come.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Whether you've chosen group
        lessons, self-teaching and one-on-one instruction from a friend or relative,
        you'll learn the game faster -- and enjoy it more -- if you take an active
        role in your bridge education. It's difficult to become a good bridge player
        if all you do is listen passively to your weekly lesson and hope it will
        &quot;soak in&quot;. Instead, make a commitment do some outside homework and
        practice. Try to devote at least a few minutes every day to some
        bridge-related activity, and make your learning process a
        &quot;multimedia&quot; one by taking advantage of lots of different resources.
        Here are some suggestions for learning activities you can pursue on your own:</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Read, read, read</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">If you're taking a group class,
        your instructor has probably given you a textbook or lesson handouts. Most
        beginning bridge textbooks aren't intended to be light reading, so don't be
        discouraged if you don't understand the material at first. Keep your book
        handy (out on your desk, next to your favorite easychair) and plan to read and
        study each chapter several times between classes.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">You'll also benefit from
        &quot;extra-curricular&quot; reading. There are dozens of good bridge books
        written just for beginners, and you might be surprised to find that they're
        entertaining as well as educational. When I learned to play, I read every book
        I could get my hands on, but I found these three to be invaluable:</font>
    <blockquote>
      <p style="line-height: 100%">
        <font size="2"><b><i>Five Weeks to Winning
              Bridge </i></b>by Alfred Sheinwold. This classic has taught millions to
          play, and it's the very first bridge book I ever read. It's organized in 35
          one-day lessons, but I read it in one weekend -- and then reread it several
          times. Sheinwold uses a 4-card-major bidding system, but you can easily
          adapt his principles to 5-card majors or any system.</font>
      <p style="line-height: 100%">
        <font size="2"><b><i>Classic Book on the Play
              of the Hand</i></b> by Louis Watson. This is the oldest and most
          comprehensive guide to understanding the cards, with a wealth of information
          on suit combinations, basic strategies and other principles of declarer
          play. You won't be able to read it in a weekend, or even a month, so plan to
          take it slow and study each chapter carefully.</font>
      <p style="line-height: 100%">
        <font size="2"><b><i>Bid Better, Play Better</i></b>
          by Dorothy Hayden (Truscott). One of the greatest bridge books of all time,
          this book focuses on teaching you how to think like a bridge player. Much of
          the material is aimed toward advanced beginners and intermediates, but even
          learners will benefit from Hayden's clear approach and practical advice.</font>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">There are a number of other
        excellent books for beginners and learners. A listing of recommended titles --
        with short reviews and links for purchase from Amazon.com -- is available in
        the <font color="#0000FF">Bridge Bookstore</font> on this site.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Read actively.</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">You may find it helpful to keep a
        notebook and a deck of cards with your class textbook and any other bridge
        books you're reading. Use the notebook to outline major points, create bidding
        diagrams or jot down questions for your instructor. The deck of cards is a
        great way to translate a textbook diagram into a &quot;real&quot; bridge hand.
        Deal out the cards to match the example in the book and play it out on a
        tabletop next to the open book. This exercise is especially beneficial if
        you're studying suit combinations from a book like Watson's <i>Play of the
          Hand</i>.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Play and learn on your computer.</font>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">ACBL's&nbsp; <a href="http://www.acbl.org/notices/ltpb.stm" target="_blank">&quot;Learn
          to Play Bridge&quot;</a> is a free program you can download and use to teach
        yourself how to play. Its lessons emphasize card play, but you'll find a good
        introduction to basic bidding here, too.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">There are also a wide range of
        bid-and-play software packages that simulate a &quot;real&quot; game. Although
        no program bids or plays like an expert, the programs are fun to play and they
        can be great teaching resources. They give you the chance to practice bidding
        and play -- with no time constraints, no limit to how often you can rebid and
        replay a hand, and no worry about disappointing a human partner. Some programs
        also have built-in lessons that you can use to teach yourself, even if you
        know absolutely nothing about bridge when you start.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">There are many good bid-and-play
        programs now on the market. My favorite is Bridge Baron (formerly called
        Micro-Bridge Companion), which is available from bridge mail-order houses for
        $59.95. A listing of software packages and links to the developers' websites
        are in the <font color="#0000FF">Bridge software</font> list on this website.</font>

      <font size="2">Tune into bridge on TV.</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Bridge instruction is also
        available on TV in several entertaining, professionally produced series. Check
        your PBS program listings to see if your local station is carrying one or more
        of these programs. A summary of the available packages and tips for getting
        your local station to run them are available at the <a href="http://www.acbl.org/~acbl/educate/teachers.htm#tv"

      <font size="2">Take advantage of Net resources.</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">You'll find a wealth of
        instructional material on the web, ready to download or print. Many of these
        sites present lessons in interesting formats, including interactive quizzes,
        Javascript play and email lessons. You can find links to some of the best in
        the <font color="#0000FF">Recommended websites for beginners</font> listing on

      <font size="2">Develop your &quot;card
        sense.&quot;</font>
    </h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">Many people believe that an
        aptitude for card games is an inborn trait -- you either have it, or you
        don't. While this may be true to some extent, I believe that any motivated,
        intelligent learner can develop these abilities. The article <font color="#0000FF">Developing
          Your Card Sense</font> on this site will give you some suggestions for mental
        exercises and other activities you can do to increase your facility with the
        cards -- and be on your way to becoming a skilled bridge player.</font>
