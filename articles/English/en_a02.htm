  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><u><font size="2">The Bidding</font></u></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Auction </b>-- the entire round 
  of bidding on a deal.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Bid </b>-- a number (1 through 
  7) followed by the name of a suit or notrump (1H, 3NT, 7C, etc.).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Call </b>-- any bid, pass, 
  double or redouble.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Contract </b>-- the number of 
  tricks the declaring side must take to earn a plus score. A bid becomes the 
  final contract if it's followed by three passes. (If the last bid is 3C, the 
  bidder has contracted to make clubs trump and to take at least 9 -- 6 for 
  &quot;book&quot; plus the 3 bid -- of the 13 possible tricks.)</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Opening bid </b>-- the first 
  bid that is not a pass. The player who makes this bid is called the 
  &quot;opener&quot;.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Response </b>-- a bid made 
  after partner has opened the bidding. The player who makes this bid is called 
  the &quot;responder&quot;.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Overcall </b>-- a bid made 
  after <b><i>an opponent </i></b>has opened the bidding. A suit overcall always 
  promises at least 5 cards in the suit bid. A notrump overcall shows a balanced 
  hand with 16-18 pts..</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Rebid </b>-- any subsequent bid 
  made by a player who has already opened, responded or overcalled in an 
  auction.</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Double </b>-- a special bid 
      that can be made only over an opponent's bid. A double describes your 
      hand, but uses up no space in the auction. If a double is followed by 
      three passes, it becomes a penalty double and increases the score of the 
      final contract. A double usually has one of two meanings, depending on the 
      previous auction:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Penalty double </b>-- 
        Usually made at a high level, when the opponents have reached their 
        final contract. This type of double is made when you expect the 
        opponents' contract to go down.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Takeout double </b>-- 
        Usually made at your first turn to bid, and at a low level. This double 
        shows strength and at least moderate length in all unbid suits. It asks 
        partner to &quot;take it out&quot; of the auction by bidding his longest 
        suit.<br>
        &nbsp;</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Redouble </font></b><font size="2">-- 
    similar to a double, but it can be made only over an opponent's double. If a 
    redouble is followed by three passes, it increases the score of the already 
    doubled contract.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Cuebid </b>-- an artificial, 
    strength-showing bid of an opponent's suit (1H by your left-hand-opponent, <b>2H</b> 
    by you). The term &quot;cuebid&quot; is also used to describe a high-level 
    bid that shows a specific ace.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Single (or simple) raise </b>-- 
    to bid partner's suit at the lowest level available (1S by partner, <b>2S</b> 
    by you). This shows a trump fit and minimum point-count.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Jump </b>-- to bid at a 
    higher level than necessary (1D by partner, <b>2NT</b> by you) to show 
    strength.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Jump raise </b>-- to bid 
    partner's suit at a higher level than necessary (1H by partner, <b>3H</b> by 
    you). These jumps show trump support and extra strength.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Invitation </b>-- to make a 
    bid (usually at a level of 2NT or higher) that asks partner to bid on to 
    game level if he has more than minimum strength.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Jump-shift </b>-- to jump and 
    change suits (1H-<b>3D</b>). This always shows a very powerful hand.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><u><font size="2">The Play</font></u></h3>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Book </b>-- the first six 
      tricks taken by declarer. Only tricks in excess of book are counted for 
      fulfilling the final contract. (To make a contract of 4S, you must take 10 
      tricks -- 6 for book plus the 4 named in the bid).</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Book also refers to the 
        number of tricks the defenders must win before they can begin earning a 
        score for defeating a contract. (If the opponents' contract is 3D, book 
        for defenders is 4 tricks -- if they take a fifth trick, they defeat 
        declarer's contract and earn a plus score.)<br>
        &nbsp;</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Declarer </font></b><font size="2">-- 
    the player who first named the suit (or notrump) specified in the final 
    contract.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Dummy </b>-- declarer's 
    partner. Dummy does not participate in the play. After the bidding is 
    completed and the opening lead is made, dummy places his cards face-up on 
    the table, sorted into suits, and they are played by declarer.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Defenders </b>-- opponents of 
    declarer.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>LHO and RHO </b>-- acronyms 
    for Left-Hand Opponent and Right-Hand Opponent.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Trick </b>-- four cards, one 
    contributed by each player in turn (clockwise around the table). The highest 
    card of the suit led (or the highest trump) wins the trick. The player who 
    wins the trick chooses the card to lead to the next trick. There are 13 
    tricks in each deal.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Lead </b>-- the first card 
    played to a trick. Each of the other three players must follow (in clockwise 
    order) by playing a card of that suit if they have one.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Opening lead </b>-- the card 
    that starts the first trick of a deal, after the bidding is over. The 
    opening leader is the player to the left of declarer.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Trump suit </b>-- the suit 
    named in the final contract.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Notrump </b>-- a contract 
    played without a trump suit. The highest card of the suit led wins the 
    trick.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Trumping (or &quot;ruffing&quot;) 
    </b>-- playing a trump on a non-trump-suit trick. A trump can be played only 
    when the trump suit is led or when you cannot follow to the lead of another 
    suit (you have no cards remaining in the suit led). A trump beats any card 
    in any other suit. If a trick contains more than one trump, the highest 
    trump wins the trick.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Discard (or pitch, or &quot;sluff&quot;) 
    </b>-- to play a non-trump card when you cannot follow to the suit led.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Finesse </b>-- an attempt to 
    trap an opponent's high card in a suit and thus avoid losing a trick to it. 
    The most common finesses are made in suits where you have most of the high 
    honors but are missing the king or queen. These holdings are called <b><i>tenaces</i></b>.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Revoke (or renege)</b> -- to 
    fail to follow suit when you actually hold one or more cards in the suit 
    led. This is a violation of bridge rules.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><u><font size="2">The Cards in Your Hand</font></u></h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Honors </b>-- Ace, King, 
    Queen, Jack (and sometimes Ten).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>High-card points </b>-- the 
    total point-count of the honors (AKQJ) in your hand.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Quick tricks</b> -- high-card 
    holdings that will usually win early tricks in the suit -- aces, kings, and 
    AK, KQ and AQ combinations. AK combination = 2 quick tricks;&nbsp; Ace or KQ 
    combination = 1 QT;&nbsp; King = 1/2 QT;&nbsp; AQ combination = 1.5 QTs.&nbsp; 
    A good opening bid usually contains 2 1/2 quick tricks. Other high-card 
    holdings (queens, jacks and QJ combinations) are often called 
    &quot;slow&quot; tricks.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Playing tricks</b> -- the 
    number of tricks that your hand will take through power (assuming equal 
    breaks of the missing cards), if&nbsp; you buy the contract. The most common 
    way to figure playing tricks is to estimate how many tricks your long suit(s) 
    will take and add that number to your quick tricks in other suits. For 
    example,&nbsp;<img height="11" src="s.gif" width="13"><b>AQJ1043&nbsp;<img height="11" src="h.gif" width="13">AK43&nbsp;<img height="11" src="d.gif" width="13">A&nbsp;<img height="11" src="c.gif" width="13">K3</b> 
    would be 9.5 playing tricks -- 5 spades and 3 hearts (assuming each of the 
    other three hands holds 3 hearts), plus the 1.5 quick tricks in the short 
    suits.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Losing-Trick Count</b> -- 
    another method of hand evaluation that figures potential losers (assuming 
    equal breaks of the missing cards), if you buy the contract. In general, you 
    count 1 loser for each missing ace, king and queen in any 3-card or longer 
    suit; for each missing ace or king in a 2-card suit; for a missing ace in a 
    1-card suit. For example, the example hand above is a 3-loser hand (counting 
    the spade king, heart queen and club ace as losers).&nbsp;<img height="11" src="s.gif" width="13"><b>A543&nbsp;<img height="11" src="h.gif" width="13">KQ43&nbsp;<img height="11" src="d.gif" width="13">QJ2&nbsp;<img height="11" src="c.gif" width="13">Q3</b> 
    would be a 7-loser hand (2 spades, 1 heart, 2 diamonds and 2 clubs).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Stoppers </b>-- protected 
    honors you hold in a suit an opponent has bid. Examples are Kx, Qxx, Jxxx. 
    This term refers to their ability to &quot;stop&quot; the opponents from 
    running their suit if you declare a notrump contract.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Controls</b> -- holdings that 
    will take the first or second trick if a suit is led. A <i>first-round 
    control</i> is an ace (or a void, for trump contracts); a <i>second-round 
    control</i> is a king or singleton.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Void </b>-- to have none of a 
    suit in your hand.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Singleton </b>-- a one-card 
    suit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Doubleton </b>-- a two-card 
    suit.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Balanced hand </b>-- having 
    no void or singleton suits and (usually) no more than one doubleton. 
    Balanced distributions of your 13 cards are 4-3-3-3 , 4-4-3-2 , 5-3-3-2 
    (sometimes 5-4-2-2).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Unbalanced (distributional) 
    hand </b>-- any hand that doesn't fit the description of a balanced hand. 
    These include two-suiters (5-5-2-1 or 6-5-2-0, etc.) and other hands with 
    voids, singletons and/or long suits (6+-cards).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Distribution points </b>-- a 
    method of hand evaluation in which you also assign points to short suits: 1 
    pt. for a doubleton, 2 pts. for a singleton, 3 pts. for a void. Add these 
    points to your high-card points to figure total point-count. Distribution 
    points should be counted after you and partner have found a trump fit. In 
    general, don't add in distribution points when deciding on an opening bid.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Tenace</b> -- a broken honor 
    combination in a suit (AQ, KJ, AJ, Q10, etc.). These holdings often allow 
    you to trap the missing honors by taking a<b><i> finesse</i></b>.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><u><font size="2">The Scoring</font></u></h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Trick score </b>-- the points 
    awarded for each trick (over book) taken by declarer if the contract is 
    made.</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Minor-suit contracts (clubs 
        and diamonds) score 20 pts. per trick.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Major-suit contracts (hearts 
        and spades) score 30 pts. per trick.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Notrump contracts score 40 
        pts. for the first trick, 30 pts. for each subsequent trick.<br>
        &nbsp;</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Game </font></b><font size="2">-- 
    a contract whose trick score will add up to at least 100 pts. if declarer 
    makes the bid number of tricks. To score a game on one deal (and receive the 
    game scoring bonus), you must bid up to a level of :</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">At least 3 in notrump (100

        &nbsp;</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Slam </font></b><font size="2">-- 
    a contract of six or seven. These contracts award large scoring bonuses.</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Small slam</b> -- any 
        contract of six, in a suit or notrump.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Grand slam </b>-- any 
        contract of seven, in a suit or notrump.<br>
        &nbsp;</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Partscore </font></b><font size="2">-- 
    any contract below game level. Trick scores from two or more part scores can 
    be combined to reach 100 pts. and earn the game bonus.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Penalty </b>-- a score given 
    to the defenders when declarer fails to make his contract (goes down).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Pass-out </b>-- a deal where 
    all four players pass. At rubber bridge, no score is recorded, and the hand 
    is redealt. At duplicate bridge, the hand is scored as 0 for each side, but 
    not redealt.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Honors </b>-- a score (100 or 
    150 pts.) awarded when declarer holds 4 or 5 of the top honors in his trump 
    suit or all 4 aces in a notrump contract. These are only counted in 
    rubber-bridge scoring.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Rubber </b>-- two games. The 
    partnership that bids and makes the first two games (or whose part scores 
    add up to two games) receives bonus points for winning the rubber.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Vulnerable </b>-- having bid 
    and made one game in the current rubber.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Not vulnerable </b>-- having 
    no game in the rubber.</font>
    <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><u><font size="2">Duplicate Bridge</font></u></h3>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>ACBL </b>-- American Contract 
    Bridge League, the national organization that sponsors and sanctions 
    duplicate games at clubs and tournaments. ACBL awards masterpoints and keeps 
    point records for members.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Masterpoints </b>-- point 
    awards for winning or placing in a duplicate-bridge event sanctioned by ACBL.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Board </b>-- the metal or 
    plastic tray that holds the pre-dealt cards. This term also refers to the 
    whole deal itself (&quot;What was our score on Board #4 ?&quot; or &quot;We 
    played 26 boards against Joe's team.&quot;).</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Bidding box</b> -- a small, 
    tabletop box that holds pre-printed cards (one for each of the 35 possible 
    bids, plus several Pass, DBL and RDBL cards) used for silent bidding. 
    Bidding boxes are used by many clubs and almost all tournaments.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Matchpoints </b>-- a form of 
    scoring used in pairs games. On each board, your score is compared to the 
    scores of the pairs who held your same cards. You receive one matchpoint for 
    every pair you beat and 1/2 matchpoint for every pair you tie. The pair with 
    the most total matchpoints on all the boards in the session wins the game.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Top </b>-- the maximum number 
    of matchpoints you can earn on a board. If a board is played eight times in 
    a duplicate session, &quot;top&quot; is 7 because the best you can do is 
    beat the other seven pairs who played it.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Bottom (or zero) </b>-- the 
    opposite of a top.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Stratified pairs or teams</b> 
    -- events that offer extra, separate masterpoint awards to novice and 
    intermediate players. Players of all skill levels enter the same event, but 
    each pair is classified into a stratum (A, B, C) based on their masterpoint 
    holding. Point awards are given to the top pairs in each stratum.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>IMPs (International Match 
    Points) </b>-- a form of scoring usually used in team games. On each board, 
    the difference between your score and your opponents' score is converted to 
    IMPs, which can be positive or negative. The team with the most total 
    positive IMPs on all boards wins the match.</font>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Swiss teams</b> -- an event 
    for teams of four players. Each team plays short matches against several 
    other teams and scores the results by IMPs. Masterpoints are awarded for 
    each match won.</font>
