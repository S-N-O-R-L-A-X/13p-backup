  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Developing counting skills</font></h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Ever wonder why good bridge 
  players seem to be able to see through the backs of your cards? Why they are 
  so successful in finding the right lead, locating missing honors, guessing the 
  distribution of their opponents’ cards? The answer is that they are usually 
  not guessing. Whether they’re defending or declaring, good players are 
  constantly gathering clues from the bidding and play and using them to make 
  logical assumptions about the location of the unseen cards.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This exercise – some call it a 
  talent -- is often called <b>card reading</b>, and it’s a skill that even 
  beginners can develop. It involves determining the overall layout – the 
  length and strength (honor holdings) of each suit in each of the two hidden 
  hands. The first and most important step in card reading is <b>counting the 
  hand,</b> which focuses on figuring out how many cards each player holds in 
  each suit.</font></p>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Counting one suit</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">At its most basic level, counting 
  involves keeping track of the cards your opponents play as you’re leading 
  one suit. If you're declaring a suit contract, you use this simple count when 
  you’re drawing trumps. If you’re declaring a notrump contract, the first 
  suit you count is the usually one that offers you the greatest number of 
  potential tricks. This is probably your longest fit, and the suit you lead 
  first.</font></p>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">As declarer, there are two main 
      techniques you can use to keep count of the cards remaining in a suit:</font>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; 
      Count <i>up</i></font></b><font size="2"> from the number of cards you and 
      dummy hold in the suit. If you have a total of 8 cards in a suit in your 
      hand and dummy, you would start your count at 8 and then mentally count up 
      to 13 as the opponents play their cards in the suit. If both opponents 
      follow to the first lead of the suit, you would count 9-10, then 11-12 on 
      the next trick. Subtracting the last number from 13 will tell you how many 
      cards the opponents still hold in the suit.&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<b>2)&nbsp;</b> <b>Count <i>down</i></b> from the 
      number of cards that are missing. With an 8-card fit, you would start your 
      count at 5 and then mentally count down to 0. If both opponents follow to 
      your first lead of the suit, you would count 5-4. The next number in the 
      sequence is the number of cards the opponents still hold.</font></dd>
  </dl>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Most players find #1 the easiest, 
  but it doesn’t really matter which approach you use. Anything you're 
  comfortable with will work fine.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can use the same counting 
  technique as a defender, with only minor variations. Start your count with the 
  number of cards you and dummy hold in the critical suit. In some cases, you'll 
  already know how many cards partner holds in that suit (from his lead or from 
  the bidding), so you’ll have a full count on the suit before any cards are 
  even played.</font>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Counting two or more suits</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Once you master counting one suit, 
  you’ll want to move on to figuring the distribution of two or more suits. To 
  do this successfully, you need:</font>
  <ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The ability to count to 13 at 
      least twice (4 times, if possible).</font>

      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Memory skills, which can be 
      developed with practice. (See <font color="#0000FF">Developing your Card 
      Sense</font> for tips on developing your bridge memory.)</font>

      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A basic knowledge of the 
      meanings of bids, <font color="#0000FF">leads </font>and <font color="#0000FF">defensive

      some energy into counting. Pay attention to every trick and modify your

  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Collecting information</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>From the bidding:&nbsp;</b> 
  &nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether you're defending or declaring, use what you 
  know from the bidding to come up with an initial picture or one or both 
  opponents' hands. You can start with very simple assumptions, such as the 
  minimum length promised by an opening bid or response. If an opponent opens 
  1H, for example, you can &quot;see&quot; at least five of his 13 cards. If 
  that opponent makes subsequent bids in the auction, you'll learn more about 
  his other 8 cards and you can often build a fairly accurate -- or sometimes 
  perfect -- picture of his hand pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can also use the bidding to 
  determine what a player does <b><i>not</i></b> hold in a suit, which will lead 
  you to conclusions about his length in other suits and, in some cases, his 
  partner's length in a suit. For example:</font>
  <ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc">
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If an opponent opens 1D and 
      then does not support his partner's major-suit response, it's guaranteed 
      that opener has 4+ diamonds (because the only time he would open 1D with a 
      3-card diamond suit is when his distribution is exactly 4-4-3-2).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If the opponents' auction goes 
      1H-1S-1NT, you'll be able to narrow down your picture of opener's hand to 
      one of three patterns: 2-5-3-3 or 3-5-3-2 or 3-5-2-3. This conclusion is 
      based on three logical assumptions:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>(1)&nbsp;</b> Opener showed a balanced hand with his 
      1NT rebid, but he did not raise his partner's 1S response (so he has 
      exactly 2 or 3 spades);<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>(2)&nbsp;</b> He did not rebid his heart suit (so he 
      holds exactly 5 hearts); and<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>(3)&nbsp;</b> He did not show a second 4+-card suit 
      (so he has at most 3 cards in each minor).&nbsp;</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Before you lead or make a critical 
  play during the hand, try to process everything you know from the bidding.&nbsp; 
  Count one hand at a time, and keep your focus on the number 13. Mentally 
  repeat each fact you've learned about that hand&nbsp; and ask yourself what 
  logical conclusion you can make from it. Then apply what you know to the other 
  unseen hands. Your thought process may go something like:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Declarer opened 1S and then bid clubs twice, so 
  he has 10 cards in those two suits. That gives him 3 cards in the red suits. 
  If he's 2-1 in those suits, that means my partner has ... . If he's 3-0, then 
  my partner has ...&quot;.</font>
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>From the opening 
  lead:</b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The opening lead will sometimes pinpoint the leader's 
  exact length in the suit. If it's a notrump contract, for example, and your 
  partner or an opponent leads the 2 of spades (or the lowest spot card),&nbsp;you'll 
  know he has exactly 4 spades (assuming 4th-best leads). The opening lead can 
  also tell you something about the leader's holding in other suits. A defender 
  will usually choose his longer, stronger suit for an opening lead to a notrump 
  contract, so if there are other unbid suits, you can figure that the leader's 
  holdings in those suits are shorter (and/or weaker) than the suit he led.&nbsp;</font>
  <p align="left" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Other leads can 
  suggest:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Shortness in a suit</b> -- a high spot-card lead to a 
  trump contract, for example.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>A specific honor holding</b> -- the lead of a queen from 
  a QJ holding.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>The lack of an honor combination</b>&nbsp; -- a lead of 
  a low card (especially to a suit contract) usually suggests that the leader 
  does not hold touching honors (AK,&nbsp;KQ, QJ, J10).</font>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>From 
  the play</b>:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As each trick is played, look for evidence and clues 
  that will help you refine your picture of the hand (or hands) you're counting. 
  Many of these are obvious, such as when a player shows out of a suit. Others 
  are more subtle and require you to make negative inferences -- why declarer 
  isn't leading hearts, why an opponent didn't return his partner's suit, why 
  he's pitching clubs instead of spades.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Watch 
  the defenders' count and attitude signals. They will be signaling each other 
  about their length and honor holdings in specific suits, and you can use this 
  information to count their hands.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Discovery 
  plays:</font></b><font size="2">&nbsp; If you're declaring and you have an 
  important guess to make in one suit, you may be able to collect extra 
  information by using a discovery play before you attack the critical suit. A 
  discovery play involves leading another suit (cashing its high cards or 
  trumping its low cards) and keeping track of how many cards each opponent 
  holds in that suit. This will help you complete your picture of the 
  opponents’ length in other suits and lead you to a more informed decision 
  about how to play the problem suit. See &quot;At the Table&quot; below for an 
  example of how to use a discovery play.&nbsp;</font></p>

  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">General tips for counting:&nbsp;</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Memorize the common 
      patterns of the 13 cards in a suit </font></b><font size="2">-- 4432,&nbsp; 
      4333,&nbsp; 4441,&nbsp; 5332,&nbsp; 5431,&nbsp; 6322,&nbsp; 7321, etc. 
      (Note that all the patterns of four numbers fall into one of two even-odd 
      combinations: three even numbers and one odd, or three odds and one even.) 
      Drill yourself on the patterns and become so familiar with them that you 
      won't even have to think once you get a partial count. If you discover 
      that each opponent has 4 cards in a suit and you hold 2 cards, you won't 
      need to do any arithmetic to know that partner holds 3. The 4432 pattern 
      will instantly pop into your head.&nbsp;</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Concentrate on how the 
      unseen cards divide.</font></b><font size="2"> Once you become adept at 
      recognizing the common patterns, start thinking not just about the number 
      of outstanding cards in a suit, but about how they might break. If your 
      hand and dummy have 8 total cards in a suit, try to focus on the possible 
      divisions of the 5 missing cards. With practice, it will become second 
      nature for you to go beyond thinking &quot;5&quot; and start thinking 
      &quot;3-2,&nbsp; 4-1,&nbsp; 5-0&quot;.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Memorize the original 
      layout.</b>&nbsp; Whether you're declaring or defending, study the dummy 
      at trick one and create a mental picture of its distribution. Commit it to 
      memory by repeating the pattern in your head (for example: 3-5-3-2, or 
      35-32). Do the same with your own hand. Later in the play, if you can't 
      remember how many cards have been played in a suit, you can often 
      reconstruct the play -- and figure out how many times the suit has been 
      led -- by recalling your mental picture of the number of cards you and 
      dummy originally held in the suit.&nbsp;</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Mentally review the bidding</font></b><font size="2"> 
      before you play to the first trick. If possible, come up with a picture of 
      each player's general hand pattern and high-card strength. Consider not 
      just what the hidden hands actually bid, but what they did <b><i>not</i></b> 
      bid.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Focus your count on just 
      one unseen hand</b>.&nbsp; The easiest hand to count will usually be the 
      player who made the most bids during the auction, or who made the opening 
      lead. Use what you know about that hand to figure the distribution of the 
      other hidden hand.&nbsp;</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Consider the skill of your 
      opponents. </font></b><font size="2">The more experienced they are, the 
      more reliable their bidding and carding will be ... and the easier it will 
      be for you to make accurate assumptions about their hands. Popular bridge 
      author Eddie Kantar observed, &quot;A madman's hand is particularly hard 
      to count, but he's usually in the wrong contract, which evens things 
      out.&quot;</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Practice, practice, 
      practice</b>.&nbsp; It will take time and lots of practice before you can 
      process all the information available and make the right conclusions. You 
      can speed your progress by making a concentrated effort to count at least 
      one or two suits on every deal you play, even on those where it appears 
      you can't affect the result. The more hands you play and the more suits 
      you count, the more adept your brain will become at remembering the cards.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>But ... don't overload your 
      neurons.</b>&nbsp; Early in the play, try to decide which suits are 
      critical and concentrate on counting just those suits. If you're declarer, 
      your count will usually be focused on your longer fits -- the one or two 
      suits where you and dummy have the most cards. If you're a defender, try 
      to start your count with the suit you or partner led, then move on to 
      figuring the distribution of one of the declaring side's longer fits.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Tips for declarers:</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Study the opening lead.</b> 
      &nbsp;Try to make some conclusions about the opening lead. Does the card 
      led suggest length or shortness in the suit?&nbsp; Does it pinpoint the 
      leader’s exact length&nbsp; (and therefore his partner's length)?&nbsp; 
      Does it show an honor combination or the lack of one?&nbsp; What does it 
      tell you about the leader’s possible length or honor holdings in other 
      suits?&nbsp;</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Play on one suit at a time.</font></b><font size="2"> 
      Once you begin drawing trumps or establishing a suit, stick with that 
      suit. If you have to lose a trick, resume leading and counting the 
      critical suit as soon as soon as you regain the lead. Resist the 
      temptation to cash high cards in other suits unless you have a clear 
      purpose in doing so (you need them for entries, for example). When you're 
      done cashing tricks in the first suit you’re counting, move on to the 
      next suit and start a new count.&nbsp;</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Watch the defenders’ 
      count and attitude signals.</font></b><font size="2"> Be aware, however, 
      that you can’t trust these implicitly. If an opponent thinks a signal 
      will be of more help to you than to his partner, he may not give an 
      accurate signal, especially late in the play.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If possible, delay your 
      important decisions. </b>Collect all the information you can about the 
      defenders' distributions before you decide how to attack a critical suit. 
      Run your long suit or cash a few extra trumps (if you can do so safely) 
      and see what you can learn from the opponents' discards. Use discovery 
      plays to get a count on side suits. If you have tricks to lose, consider 
      giving the defenders the lead to see if they'll provide you with a 
      discovery play.&nbsp;</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">Play the odds.&nbsp;</font></b><font size="2"> 
      If, for example, you have a two-way guess for the location of a queen, use 
      your count in the suit to decide which way to finesse. If you determine 
      from the bidding or play that one opponent is likely to have more length 
      in the suit, finesse that opponent for the missing queen.&nbsp;(See 
      &quot;At the Table&quot; below for an example of this situation.)</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Tips for defenders:</font></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Watch partner's signals.</b> 
      They tell you about his length and possible high-card holdings in key 
      suits.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Give partner good signals</b> 
      so he can count out the hand, too. Use your judgment here, though. Some 
      signals help declarer more than they help your partner, so it’s 
      sometimes right to withhold a count signal if you think it will tell 
      declarer how to play a suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Find a time to add up what 
      you know.</b> Think while declarer or partner is thinking or when it's 
      your lead. If possible, avoid long thought when it’s your turn to follow 
      suit. Make your decisions early and be ready to follow smoothly when 
      declarer or dummy leads.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Beware of falsecards </b>-- 
      especially those that won't fool declarer, but will fool partner. If you 
      hold QJ2 of a suit and play the 2 and then the queen when declarer cashes 
      the ace-king, you’ll lead partner to believe that your original holding 
      was Q2. If he’s trying to count the hand, this clue will lead him 
      astray.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Tips for dummy (yes, dummy):</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your stint as dummy is the perfect 
  time to practice your counting skills. Even though you can see only your own 
  hand, you can work on developing a mental picture of the distribution in the 
  other three hands. Analyze the bidding and opening lead and add up what you 
  know about each player’s suit length. Then watch the played tricks and the 
  defenders' signals and try counting the number of cards each player holds in 
  each suit. This is great practice because there's no pressure; if you make any 
  errors, they're &quot;free&quot;, and no one will know.</font></p>

          guess, or do you have a clue that will help you make the decision?&nbsp;</font>
          <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">There's no discovery play 
          available here, since cashing your other tricks first is unlikely to 
          give you any helpful information. All you have to go on is your count 
          in the heart suit, which you've already determined by watching the 
          cards played to the first two tricks.</font>
          <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here, LHO led the heart 3 
          and then followed with the 2, so he's shown that he holds 5 hearts 
          (Qxx32). RHO therefore has 3 hearts (A9x).&nbsp;</font>
          <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When you're in doubt about 
          the location of a specific card, the odds favor it being in the hand 
          that has the most &quot;room&quot; to hold that card. Your count in 
          the heart suit tells you there are 8 chances that LHO has the diamond 
          queen (he had 5 hearts, so has 8 unknown cards) and 10 chances that 
          RHO has the queen (he had 3 hearts, so has 10 unknown cards). So your 
          best play is to cash the diamond king and lead the 10, planning to 
          finesse RHO for the diamond queen.</font></p>

          change your mind if you stop to count out the hand. Try to answer

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Focus your count 
  on declarer's hand.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>How many clubs does he hold?</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  </span>Exactly 4 (because the lead shows that partner holds exactly 4 clubs).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>How many diamonds?</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><b>&nbsp;</b> 
  </span>At least 4 (because he didn't raise spades).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>How many hearts?</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><b>&nbsp; 
  </b>Exactly 4. Declarer didn't open 1H, so he has fewer than 5 hearts. It 
  appears that partner also has fewer than 5 hearts, since he surely would have 
  led a </span>5-card heart suit rather than a 4-card club suit. The 8 hearts 
  that you can't see must therefore be divided 4-4 in partner's and declarer's 
  hands. (Note that you also have a clue that partner doesn't hold a heart 
  honor. Since partner is 4-4 in hearts and clubs and he chose clubs for his 
  opening lead, his clubs are probably stronger than his hearts.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b>How many spades?</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><b>&nbsp;</b> 
  You've counted declarer's hand to be 4-4-4 in the other three suits, so that 
  leaves him with one </span>spade. That means partner has three spades with at 
  least one honor.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that without a count, you probably wouldn't have 
  expected opener to have a singleton for his 1NT rebid. Many players, however, 
  prefer this approach when they have a 1-4-4-4 pattern. The alternative with 
  this hand is to bid 2C (showing a minor two-suiter), which is also a 
  distortion.&nbsp;</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can also add 
  up the high-card points here. Declarer's minimum notrump rebid tells you he 
  has 12 to 14 points. (If he had 15 pts., he would have opened a 15-17 1NT.) 
  Add declarer's points to the 20 total points in your hand and dummy, and you 
  can determine that partner holds from 6&nbsp; to 8 high-card points.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Did you find the 
  killing shift? It's right to lead a low spade at trick two. Partner wins the 
  spade ace and returns a spade for down one. Your side will eventually score 
  seven tricks -- three spades, the AK of clubs and the two red aces.&nbsp;<br>

          you're counting the opponents' cards, though, you might come to a 
          different conclusion. And if you use a simple discovery play, you may

  </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus your count on opener (RHO).&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So far, you know 9 of his 13 cards -- 6 hearts and 3 
  spades.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You've seen 10 of his high-card points -- the AKQ of hearts 
  and the jack of spades.<br>

  insurance -- the discovery play:&nbsp;</b><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you make the critical play in the club suit, 
  play on diamonds to gather more information about RHO's distribution. Cash the 
  king and ace and trump one of dummy's small diamonds. RHO will follow to all 
  three diamonds, so you now have all the information you need to take three 
  sure club tricks.&nbsp;You may also see more of RHO's high-card points on the 
  diamond tricks, but the most important information here is his distribution.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You now know 12 of RHO's 13 cards -- 3 spades, 6 
  hearts and at least 3 diamonds. That leaves him with a void or singleton in 
  clubs, so you have a &quot;marked&quot; finesse. Cash the club ace, just in 
  case RHO has the singleton queen. If the queen doesn't fall, finesse LHO for 
  his known queen by leading a low club to dummy's 10.&nbsp;</font></p>
