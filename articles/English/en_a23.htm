  Bridge Game</font></b></h2>
  <hr>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><u><font size="2">When you're declarer:</font></u></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Don't play to the first trick 
  too quickly.</b> Force yourself to stop and think when dummy comes down.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Concentrate on the opening lead</b> 
  for a few seconds so you'll remember it later. Decide what it tells you about 
  the leader's length or strength in that suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Mentally review the bidding.</b> 
  If one of your opponents has bid, try to come up with a general picture of his 
  point-count and his length in the suit bid.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>For <i>most</i> suit contracts,</b> 
  your general plan should be:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>1 -</b> Count your <b>losers. 
    </b>Decide which ones can be disposed of or turned into winners (by 
    trumping, by finessing or by discarding them on a side suit).<br>
    <b>2 -</b> If your plan calls for trumping one or more of your losers in the 
    short-trump hand (usually dummy), do that <b><i>before</i></b> you lead 
    trumps -- even if you have to give up tricks to set up the trumping 
    position.<br>
    <b>3 -</b> Next, lead out your trumps, counting as the opponents follow to 
    each trick. (This will usually be your best approach if you have good honor 
    strength and/or length in one or more of the outside suits.)<br>
    <b>4 -</b> Attack your longest side suit. Give up your losers early.<br>
    <b>5 -</b> Last, cash honors in your short suits.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>For <i>most</i> notrump 
  contracts,</b> your general plan should be:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>1 - </b>Count your <b>winners.</b> 
    If you don't have enough top tricks to make your contract, decide which suit 
    offers you the best chance of creating more winners.<br>
    <b>2 - </b>Attack that suit first (it will usually be your longest side 
    suit). Give up the tricks you have to lose early.<br>
    <b>3 - </b>Stick with one suit at a time. Keep leading it until you've 
    established your tricks (counting the defenders' cards as you go), then cash 
    your winners in the suit. When you move to a different suit, start counting 
    again.<br>
    <b>4 -</b> Last, cash honors in your short suits.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><u><font size="2">When you're a defender:</font></u></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Lead attacking combinations</b> 
  (suits with touching honors -- QJ10x, KQxx, etc.).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Don't lead unsupported aces</b> 
  (Ax, Axx, Axxx) <b><i>unless </i></b>it's the suit partner has bid.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>When in doubt about what to 
  lead</b>, lead the fourth-best card in your longest suit. Leading from length 
  is the &quot;standard&quot; lead to a notrump contract, and it's often the 
  safest lead to a suit contract.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Count cards and points</b> as 
  you play. Use clues from the bidding, the opening lead and the play to try to 
  come up with a mental picture of partner's or declarer's hand.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Think ahead</b>, and be ready 
  for critical plays. Indecision will often tell declarer what you hold in a 
  suit, so try to decide in advance which card you'll play when declarer leads a 
  suit toward or from dummy.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Use defensive signals</b> to 
  help partner during the play:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When discarding or following 
      suit, signal with the highest card possible in a suit you want partner to 
      lead. Play a low card if you have no interest in the suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When following suit, use count 
      signals to help partner figure out how many cards you hold in the suit. 
      Playing <b><i>high-low</i></b> in a suit tells partner you have an <b><i>even</i></b> 
      number of cards. Playing <b><i>low, then high</i></b> shows an <b><i>odd</i></b> 
      number of cards.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><u><font size="2">When you're bidding:</font></u></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Always search for a major-suit 
  fit</b> if one is possible, even if you've already found a minor fit. If you 
  have a 4-card major you can show at the one-level, always bid it.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Consider playing 3NT</b> 
  instead of 5C of 5D when you have the strength for game, but your only fit is 
  in a minor suit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If you have length in the 
  opponent's suit</b> and are in doubt about what to bid, pass. Don't show your 
  problem by thinking too long about what to do.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Keep the bidding simple.</b> If 
  you have a fit for partner's major, always raise.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If you have a fit for partner's 
  suit,</b> &quot;stretch&quot; to raise, especially in a competitive auction. 
  If you have extra trumps (one more than you need for an 8-card fit), feel free 
  to compete to the 3-level if the opponents bid over your 2-level partscore.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Always assume partner has a 
  minimum</b> until he tells you otherwise. A minimum range is 13-15 pts. if 
  partner opened the bidding; 6-9 pts. if he responded to your opening bid.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If you have a minimum hand</b> 
  (13-15 pts. for opener, 6-9 or 10 pts. for responder), keep the bidding low 
  until you find a fit. <b><i>Don't go past the one-level unless:</i></b></font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You're raising partner's suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You're rebidding your own long 
      suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You're bidding a second suit 
      that's <b><i>lower in rank </i></b>than your first suit (1D by you-1S by 
      partner-<b>2C</b> by you) or (1D-1S-1NT-<b>2H</b>).</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Once you've decided to raise 
  partner's suit, rebid your own long suit or bid notrump<i>,</i></b> be sure 
  you show your point-count by bidding at the proper level:</font>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you know you have 25 
      combined points, jump to game in your suit or notrump. Don't give partner 
      a chance to pass.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you have an invitational 
      hand (16-18 pts. if you're opener; 10-12 pts. if you're responder) and you 
      think you and partner <b><i>might</i></b> have 25+ points, make your bid 
      one level higher than necessary. This usually means you'll freely take the 
      auction to 2NT or 3 of your suit.</font>
    <li>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you have a minimum hand, 
      show it by making your bid at the lowest level available.</font></li>
  </ul>
