  lessons and self-teaching</font></h2>
  <hr width="100%">
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you've ever wondered what 
  bridge is all about -- or if you've always wanted to learn but have been 
  afraid it's too difficult -- here are some tips (and encouragement) to help 
  you join the millions of people who are hooked on this fascinating game. With 
  all the new learning opportunities now available, there's never been a better 
  time to take up the game. More and more communities, bridge clubs and schools 
  are offering group lessons, and there's a wealth of new material on the 
  Internet to supplement classes and help you teach yourself.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">It takes only rudimentary 
  knowledge to begin playing and enjoying bridge, but be forewarned: this is not 
  an easy game to learn, and it's even more difficult (most say impossible) to 
  master. But that's precisely why bridge is so popular, and why it's called 
  &quot;the game for a lifetime&quot;. No matter how many years you play, you'll 
  always find new challenges, and the learning process will never end. I've been 
  playing non-stop for 25 years, and I learn something new every time I play.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">There are several ways to begin 
  learning the game. Here's a look at some of the different approaches you can 
  take, and some advice about which work best for most people.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Think twice about asking a friend 
  or relative to teach you.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">I've taught hundreds of people to 
  play bridge, and one of the most frequent comments I hear from students is, 
  &quot;My husband (or mother or sister or room-mate) tried to teach me to play 
  years ago, but we were both miserable!&quot;</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Of course, many people have been 
  successfully taught by close friends and relatives. The one-on-one teaching 
  can be fun and can even bring the two of you closer together, but just know 
  that there are pitfalls.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">One is that teaching the game is 
  very different than playing it, and even the most skilled player may not know 
  how to share his knowledge. Inexperienced teachers tend to overload their 
  students with too much information too fast, and the learner can be quickly 
  overwhelmed. And if you're in a close personal relationship with your tutor, 
  he or she may have unrealistic expectations of how fast you should progress.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Another problem is that for many 
  people, the closer the relationship, the more difficult the teacher-learner 
  roles are to handle. My experience with my husband is a good example. We first 
  met at a duplicate-bridge club when I barely knew how to sort my cards. He was 
  much more experienced, and when we began playing as partners, he was a 
  tremendous, and patient, teacher. I hung on his every word and even took 
  notes. After a year or so, though, I started to feel that my skill level was 
  approaching his, and the conflicts began. I started questioning some of his 
  advice about how to bid or play a hand, and even began offering him some of my 
  own. I was anxious to stop being the &quot;student&quot;, but he was reluctant 
  to give up his role as the &quot;teacher&quot;, and it was very difficult for 
  us to adjust to thinking of each other as equal partners.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Sign up for group lessons if 
  they're available in your community.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Even if you want to have a friend 
  or relative teach you, consider supplementing that instruction with a series 
  of outside classes. The learning process is easier -- and usually a lot more 
  fun -- if you're part of a group of beginners. There's much less pressure than 
  with one-on-one teaching, and you'll get a lot of support from classmates and 
  the teacher. A lesson series also puts you on a learning schedule -- it gives 
  you a set time each week to get out of the house and immerse yourself in the 
  game.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>How to find classes and 
  teachers:</b>&nbsp; Many park districts, adult-education programs and 
  community colleges offer group lessons.&nbsp; The classes usually begin in 
  early fall and early spring, but bigger cities may offer year-round lessons. A 
  typical lesson format is 6-8 sessions of 2-3 hours each (with much of the 
  class time devoted to play). Bridge lessons are also being offered to 
  junior-high and high-school students in a special program from the American 
  Contract Bridge League.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your best source of classes and 
  information is probably your local duplicate-bridge club. If the directors 
  there don't offer classes, they'll be able to tell you where you can find one. 
  Your town's bridge club may be listed in the white or yellow pages. To get a 
  complete listing of the clubs in your area, check the American Contract Bridge 
  League's <a href="http://www.acbl.org/info/clubs.stm" target="_blank">Directory 
  of Duplicate-Bridge Clubs </a>. The listing is organized by state and city and 
  will give you the club address and the name and phone number of a contact 
  person.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The ACBL also maintains a 
  state-by-state listing of bridge teachers. Check their <a href="http://www.acbl.org/educate/teachers.stm" target="_blank">Bridge 
  Teacher Directory </a>to find the name and phone number of a bridge teacher in 
  your hometown.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Try teaching yourself to play.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you can't fit a group class 
  into your schedule, don't give up. It is possible to teach yourself, 
  especially if you take advantage of all the new sources of information. 
  Learning on your own has become fun, and almost easy, with the availability of 
  new bridge books, television programs, web sites, online clubs and bridge 
  software. Some good <font color="#0000FF">websites for beginners</font> are 
  listed on this site.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Put some energy into the learning 
  process.</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Whether you're teaching yourself 
  or taking group lessons, bridge can't be learned passively. The fastest 
  learners are those who jump in and make the game their personal projects. They 
  take advantage of all the opportunities for learning and devote time to 
  reading and practicing on their own. Some tips and ideas for personal practice 
  are in the article <font color="#0000FF">&quot;On-your-own&quot; Learning 
  Activities</font> on this site.<br>
