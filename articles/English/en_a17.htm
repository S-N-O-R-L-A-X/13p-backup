    </h2>

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">A good declarer relies on a
        variety of skills, strategies and techniques to help him make his contracts.
        One of the most basic is knowing how to handle common card combinations. You
        also need some knowledge of how long suits are likely to divide in the
        opponents' hands, and you need to learn how to detect and use clues from the
        opponents' bidding and play.</font>
    </p>
    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2">The most important of all
        declarer-play skills, though, is the ability to look at the entire hand -- all
        13 tricks -- and develop an overall plan for making your contract. You should
        never just cash tricks randomly and hope you'll know what to do later --
        ideally, you want to have a reason for every lead and play. Here are some
        basic guidelines for how to form your plan for suit and notrump contracts:</font>

          your counting on the hand with the longer trumps.&nbsp; If you have too
          many losers to make your contract, don't give up. There are a number of

    <p style="line-height: 100%">
      <font size="2"><b>3)</b> Decide which suits
        you'll attack, and in what order. On many (but not all) hands, you'll want to
        exploit your advantage in the trump suit by leading trumps first -- your plan
        will be to take all the opponents' trumps away and still have trumps remaining
        in your and/or dummy's hands to handle your losers. To be sure that this will
        be the right plan, count your losers first, then try counting <b><i>winners</i></b>
        (honors and potential long-suit tricks) in your outside suits. Add these
        winners to your tricks in the trump suit to determine whether or not you have
        enough &quot;natural&quot; tricks to make your contract.</font>

        <font size="2"><b>If you DO have enough
            &quot;natural&quot; winners to make your contract, lead trumps right away.
          </b>Plan to collect all the opponents' trumps, even if you have to lose
          the lead to do so. This will make it possible for you to cash your outside
          winners without worrying that an opponent will trump one of your good
          tricks.</font>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="line-height: 100%">
              <font size="2"><b><i>Always count the
                    opponents' trumps</i></b> as you lead the suit to keep track of how many
                they still have after each trick. One easy counting technique is to
                mentally start with the number of trumps in your two hands, then count
                &quot;up&quot; as you see each trump from an opponent's hand. For
                example, if you have an 8-card fit, you start with the number 8 -- if
                both opponents follow to your first trump lead, you mentally count 9-10.
                When you get to 13, you have all their trumps and you should stop
                leading them. For more tips on how to keep track of outstanding cards in
                a suit, see <font color="#0000FF">Developing Your Counting Skills</font>.</font>
          <li>
            <p style="line-height: 100%">
              <font size="2">Think about how many trumps
                the opponents started with and try to estimate in advance how many times
                you'll have to lead the suit to draw all their cards. If you have an
                8-card fit, you'll have to lead trumps at least three times (if the
                opponents' cards break 3-2). If you have a 9-card fit, you'll need only
                two leads if the missing cards break 2-2, or three leads if they break
                3-1.&nbsp;</font>
          <li>
            <p style="line-height: 100%">
              <font size="2">You can stop leading trumps
                if there's only one outstanding and it's a winner -- for example, you've
                drawn four of the opponents' trumps with your ace-king and one opponent
                is now left with the good queen. In this case, you usually won't want to
                use two of your trumps to get his one, so you can begin leading other
                suits and let the opponent score the trump queen whenever he wants.</font>

            &quot;natural&quot; winners to make your contract,</font>
        </b>
        <font size="2">
          you'll usually want to postpone leading trumps. This may depend on your
          estimate of how many leads it would take to draw trumps and whether these
          leads would remove all the trumps from your hand or dummy's.</font>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="line-height: 100%">
              <font size="2">For example, if you have 5
                trumps in your hand and dummy has 3, it will take at least three leads
                to collect all the opponents' trumps. If&nbsp; you need to use dummy's
                trumps to take care of&nbsp; one or more of your hand's losers, you must
                set that up <b><i>before</i></b> you lead trumps. This may involve
                giving up a trick or two so you can run dummy out of the suit you need
                to trump. When you've finished using dummy's trumps in this way, you can
                then lead trumps.</font>
          <li>
            <p style="line-height: 100%">
              <font size="2">On other hands, you may need
                to try to score <b><i>all</i></b> of your trumps separately. In this
                case, your plan will be to play a <b><i>cross-ruff</i></b>, by trumping
                outside suits in both your hand and dummy's. Here's an example:</font>

              <font size="2">You're in a 2H contract
                and the opening lead is the spade queen. You have only three obvious
                losers (two spades and one heart). When you count actual <b><i>winners</i></b>,
                though, you have only six -- three natural trump tricks and the three
                aces. None of the outside suits offers a chance to develop quick
                natural winners, so you'll have to find extra tricks from the trump
                suit.&nbsp;<br>
                Since you need to score trumps separately, <b><i>don't </i></b>lead
                hearts. Instead, play a cross-ruff. Win the spade ace, cash dummy's
                diamond ace, and lead a small diamond, trumping it in your hand. Now
                cash your club ace and trump a club in dummy. Continue trumping
                diamonds in your hand and clubs in dummy. Eventually, an opponent will
                be able to over-ruff with the heart ace and lead another heart to stop
                the cross-ruff. By then, though, you'll have scored the extra trump
                tricks you needed, and you should finish with at least 8 tricks.&nbsp;</font>
