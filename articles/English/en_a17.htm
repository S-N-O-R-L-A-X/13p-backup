  <h2 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="4">Declarer Play I -- Forming a Plan</font></h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A good declarer relies on a 
  variety of skills, strategies and techniques to help him make his contracts. 
  One of the most basic is knowing how to handle common card combinations. You 
  also need some knowledge of how long suits are likely to divide in the 
  opponents' hands, and you need to learn how to detect and use clues from the 
  opponents' bidding and play.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">The most important of all 
  declarer-play skills, though, is the ability to look at the entire hand -- all 
  13 tricks -- and develop an overall plan for making your contract. You should 
  never just cash tricks randomly and hope you'll know what to do later -- 
  ideally, you want to have a reason for every lead and play. Here are some 
  basic guidelines for how to form your plan for suit and notrump contracts:</font></p>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Playing Suit Contracts</font></h3>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>1) </b>Count your <b><i>losers</i></b> 
      as soon as dummy comes down. If&nbsp; you have a 5-3 or a 6-2 fit, focus 
      your counting on the hand with the longer trumps.&nbsp; If you have too 
      many losers to make your contract, don't give up. There are a number of 
      plays you can use to turn losers into winners:</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Finessing</b> to trap the 
        opponents' honors. (See <font color="#0000FF">The Finesse</font> for how 
        to handle some common card combinations.)</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Developing long-suit 
        winners</b> in a side suit to pitch losers in other suits. (See <font color="#0000FF">Establishing 
        and Cashing Tricks</font>.)</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>Trumping</b> if one hand 
        is short in a suit.</font></li>
    </ul>
  </dl>
  <b>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">2)</font></b><font size="2"> Make 
  a plan for which of these plays you will use to develop extra tricks in each 
  suit.</font></p>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>3)</b> Decide which suits 
  you'll attack, and in what order. On many (but not all) hands, you'll want to 
  exploit your advantage in the trump suit by leading trumps first -- your plan 
  will be to take all the opponents' trumps away and still have trumps remaining 
  in your and/or dummy's hands to handle your losers. To be sure that this will 
  be the right plan, count your losers first, then try counting <b><i>winners</i></b> 
  (honors and potential long-suit tricks) in your outside suits. Add these 
  winners to your tricks in the trump suit to determine whether or not you have 
  enough &quot;natural&quot; tricks to make your contract.</font>
  <dl>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b>If you DO have enough 
      &quot;natural&quot; winners to make your contract, lead trumps right away. 
      </b>Plan to collect all the opponents' trumps, even if you have to lose 
      the lead to do so. This will make it possible for you to cash your outside 
      winners without worrying that an opponent will trump one of your good 
      tricks.</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><b><i>Always count the 
        opponents' trumps</i></b> as you lead the suit to keep track of how many 
        they still have after each trick. One easy counting technique is to 
        mentally start with the number of trumps in your two hands, then count 
        &quot;up&quot; as you see each trump from an opponent's hand. For 
        example, if you have an 8-card fit, you start with the number 8 -- if 
        both opponents follow to your first trump lead, you mentally count 9-10. 
        When you get to 13, you have all their trumps and you should stop 
        leading them. For more tips on how to keep track of outstanding cards in 
        a suit, see <font color="#0000FF">Developing Your Counting Skills</font>.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Think about how many trumps 
        the opponents started with and try to estimate in advance how many times 
        you'll have to lead the suit to draw all their cards. If you have an 
        8-card fit, you'll have to lead trumps at least three times (if the 
        opponents' cards break 3-2). If you have a 9-card fit, you'll need only 
        two leads if the missing cards break 2-2, or three leads if they break 
        3-1.&nbsp;</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can stop leading trumps 
        if there's only one outstanding and it's a winner -- for example, you've 
        drawn four of the opponents' trumps with your ace-king and one opponent 
        is now left with the good queen. In this case, you usually won't want to 
        use two of your trumps to get his one, so you can begin leading other 
        suits and let the opponent score the trump queen whenever he wants.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <dd>
      <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font>
    <dt style="line-height: 100%"><b><font size="2">If you DON'T have enough 
      &quot;natural&quot; winners to make your contract,</font></b><font size="2"> 
      you'll usually want to postpone leading trumps. This may depend on your 
      estimate of how many leads it would take to draw trumps and whether these 
      leads would remove all the trumps from your hand or dummy's.</font>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">For example, if you have 5 
        trumps in your hand and dummy has 3, it will take at least three leads 
        to collect all the opponents' trumps. If&nbsp; you need to use dummy's 
        trumps to take care of&nbsp; one or more of your hand's losers, you must 
        set that up <b><i>before</i></b> you lead trumps. This may involve 
        giving up a trick or two so you can run dummy out of the suit you need 
        to trump. When you've finished using dummy's trumps in this way, you can 
        then lead trumps.</font>
      <li>
        <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">On other hands, you may need 
        to try to score <b><i>all</i></b> of your trumps separately. In this 
        case, your plan will be to play a <b><i>cross-ruff</i></b>, by trumping 
        outside suits in both your hand and dummy's. Here's an example:</font></li>
    </ul>
  </dl>
  <table cellSpacing="3" cellPadding="3" width="588" border="1">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td width="68">

        <td width="490">
          <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You're in a 2H contract 
          and the opening lead is the spade queen. You have only three obvious 
          losers (two spades and one heart). When you count actual <b><i>winners</i></b>, 
          though, you have only six -- three natural trump tricks and the three 
          aces. None of the outside suits offers a chance to develop quick 
          natural winners, so you'll have to find extra tricks from the trump 
          suit.&nbsp;<br>
          Since you need to score trumps separately, <b><i>don't </i></b>lead 
          hearts. Instead, play a cross-ruff. Win the spade ace, cash dummy's 
          diamond ace, and lead a small diamond, trumping it in your hand. Now 
          cash your club ace and trump a club in dummy. Continue trumping 
          diamonds in your hand and clubs in dummy. Eventually, an opponent will 
          be able to over-ruff with the heart ace and lead another heart to stop 
          the cross-ruff. By then, though, you'll have scored the extra trump 
          tricks you needed, and you should finish with at least 8 tricks.&nbsp;</font></p>
