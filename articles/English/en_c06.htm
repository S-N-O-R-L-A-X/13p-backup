  that a cuebid? (Part 1)</font></h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">This hand was the subject of an 
  interesting discussion on the Internet newsgroup <i>rec.games.bridge</i>:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">&nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11"><strong>Void

  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Playing a two-over-one 
  forcing-to-game system, partner opens 1S and you bid a forcing 1NT. Partner 
  now rebids 3S and it's your call.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Newsgroup readers who responded to 
  the problem chose Pass, 4C, 5C, 3NT and even a raise to 4S. Many of the 4C 
  bidders thought their choice was &quot;obvious&quot;. As others pointed out, 
  however, if you and partner haven't discussed this particular auction before, 
  are you sure he'll know you're showing a club <i><b>suit</b></i>? He might 
  well interpret your 4C as a cuebid for a spade slam, thinking you were 
  describing a 3-card limit-raise -- a hand like &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">J65 
  &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">84 &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">KQ75 
  &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">A1095 .</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">What <i><b>should</b></i> 4C mean 
  in this auction? There are merits for both treatments -- natural or a cuebid 
  -- but neither meaning has value unless you and partner interpret it the same 
  way.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Best, of course, would be to have 
  a specific agreement about this auction before it happens. (You may well have 
  one <i><b>after</b></i> the hand, especially if you have a disaster.) In 
  practice, though, it's impossible to discuss every sequence that might come up 
  at the table. No matter how long you play with your partner, you'll always 
  encounter unique situations that aren't covered by your current agreements or 
  conventions.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A practical way to handle this 
  kind of problem is to have what might be called &quot;default&quot; agreements 
  -- simple rules that are broadly phrased to cover all undiscussed sequences. 
  To handle the situation above, your partnership could have one of two 
  defaults:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>Default #1</u>:</strong> 
    An ambiguous new-suit bid at the 4-level or higher is a cuebid; <strong><i>OR</i></strong></font>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>Default #2</u>: </strong>If 
    an ambiguous new-suit bid could be natural, it is.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Using Default #1</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you and your partner make #1 
  your default agreement, you can't use a 4C bid to suggest a new trump suit. To 
  show long, strong clubs, you'd have to jump to 5C. Partner should have no 
  trouble interpreting this as a long suit, especially since he knows your 
  default agreement prevented you from bidding a natural 4C.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You could also choose to make 
  Default #1 more specific by stipulating that it applies <i><b>only</b></i> if 
  partner has shown extra length in his suit. This would clarify the meaning of 
  auctions like these:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">      <u>You    Partner</u>

(1)    --      1S   
       2H      3C 
       3H      4D 

(2)    1H      1S  
       4H      5C   

      <u> You   LHO   Partner   RHO</u> 
(3)    1H     2D     Dbl*    4D       *(negative double)   
       4H    Pass    4S  

</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In all three auctions, you can 
  safely interpret partner's last bid as a cuebid showing support for your 
  hearts. However, if you use the &quot;extra-length&quot; requirement, your 
  default agreement would <i><b>not</b></i> apply to this sequence:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">     <u>You    Partner</u>    
      1S      2H   
      3D      4C    </font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here, partner's 4C should be 
  natural (and forcing), since you haven't promised extra length in either of 
  your suits.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Keep in mind that the key word in 
  these agreements is &quot;ambiguous&quot;. The default rules are in effect <i><b>only</b></i> 
  for situations you haven't previously discussed and for which an alternate 
  meaning isn't obvious. For example, if you use Default #1, it would <i><b>not</b></i> 
  apply in these auctions:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">     <u>LHO   You   RHO   Partner</u>  
     3D    3S    Pass   4H   

     <u>You     Partner</u>      
      3S      4H </font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In either case, there should be 
  nothing ambiguous about partner's 4H bid. In the first auction, it's his first 
  chance to show a long suit and you haven't promised significant extra length 
  in spades, so 4H must be natural. You also have the inference that if partner 
  wanted to show strong spade support, he could have cuebid 4D or jumped to 5S.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In the second auction, there's 
  already a &quot;standard&quot; interpretation that partner's 4H bid is to play 
  (unless you've previously agreed on another meaning). In addition, common 
  sense tells you there would be little reason for partner to intend 4H as a 
  slam try, since this would mean he lacked controls in clubs and diamonds.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Using Default #2</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you and partner decide to use 
  Default #2 (&quot;If it could be natural, it is&quot;), you'd be comfortable 
  with a 4C bid with the hand above. That leads to a second question: Is it 
  forcing? To cover this, you could agree to one of these general defaults:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>Default 2-A</u>:</strong> 
    An ambiguous new-suit bid is always natural and forcing.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>Default 2-B</u>:</strong> 
    An ambiguous new-suit bid is natural but <strong><i>non-forcing </i></strong>if 
    the bidder has previously limited his hand.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With A as your default, your 4C 
  rebid would be forcing. If you instead use B, opener would be allowed to pass 
  4C because your 1NT response had already limited your strength. Default B 
  would also apply anytime you were a passed hand.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Your partnership can decide how to 
  word your agreements and what restrictions to put on them. Be careful, 
  however, about making these &quot;catchall&quot; rules too specific. They 
  offer the biggest benefits if they're simple and easy to remember -- and if 
  they're general enough that you can apply them to a wide range of bidding 
  problems.</font>

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Partner responds 2D and you rebid 
  4C -- a splinter showing diamond support and a singleton club. Partner now 
  bids 4H.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">How do you interpret partner's 4H? 
  If you believe your auction has absolutely set diamonds as trumps, then you 
  can probably assume 4H is a cuebid for a diamond slam. Partner might have a 
  hand like &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">832 &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A 
  &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ8752 &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">Q65 
  where he needs only to hear a spade cuebid from you to be able to use 
  Blackwood.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Or is 4H a natural call? If 
  partner is trying to show a minimum with 3-card heart support -- &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ 
  &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">854 &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ762 
  &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K75 -- you'd better 
  pass before you get too high.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Dilemmas like this one come up 
  often, even in the most practiced partnerships. It's impossible to discuss 
  every sequence that might come up at the table, but if you have a few 
  &quot;default&quot; agreements in place, you can improve the chances that you 
  and partner will interpret an unusual auction in the same way.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">A default agreement is a simple, 
  broadly phrased guideline that applies to sequences that aren't covered by 
  your other agreements or conventions. To handle situations like the one above, 
  your partnership could have one of two defaults:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>Default #1:</u></strong> 
    A game bid in a major suit previously bid by either partner is an offer to 
    play there; <strong><i>OR</i></strong></font>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>Default #2</u></strong>: 
    A forcing-to-game raise always sets trumps; all subsequent bids in other 
    suits are cuebids.</font>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Worded more simply, Default #1 is 
  a variation of the broader default &quot;If it could be natural, it is&quot;; 
  Default #2 is &quot;If it could be a cuebid, it is.&quot; Which is better? In 
  practice, #1 will probably help you handle more common problems, especially 
  those that arise in crowded auctions. Default #2 will give you more accuracy 
  in some slam auctions, but it requires you to further define exactly what 
  qualifies as a forcing raise.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Default #1 also conforms to the 
  old bridge tenet of &quot;game before slam&quot; (which can function as a 
  default agreement all by itself). This popular advice suggests that when 
  making choices about how to structure your system or interpret a bid, finding 
  the best game should take priority over searching for slam. This means that 
  when in doubt, you should treat an ambiguous bid as a natural suggestion of a 
  trump suit or as a try for game, rather than as an advance cuebid for a 
  possible slam.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Whichever default you choose, 
  remember that its purpose is not to provide the &quot;perfect&quot; solution 
  to every problem; it's only designed to help you avoid major 
  misunderstandings. If you use Default #1 and partner happens to hold the first 
  hand above -- one with which he really <i><b>wants</b></i> to cuebid 4H -- he 
  can't. Instead, he'll have to &quot;stall&quot; with 4D, which is forcing, and 
  hope you'll cuebid a spade control.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Using your default</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Let's see how these agreements can 
  help you sort out what's going on in other auctions. Would you interpret the 
  last bid in each sequence below as natural or as a cuebid?</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">    <u> You    Partner 
</u>(1)   --      1S   
      1NT     3C   
      4C      4S   

<strong>(2)</strong>   1D      1H   
      2NT     3D   
      3S      4H

<strong>(3)</strong>   1D      1S   
      2H      3D   
      3S      4H  

(4)   --      1D  [<i>2H overcall</i>]
      DBL*    3H               * (negative double)   
      4D      4S 

<strong>(5)</strong>   1S      2D   
      2S      3H   
      3S      4H   

</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Without a previous discussion or a 
  default agreement, these auctions would cause problems for many partnerships. 
  If you rely on Default #1, though, you can safely assume partner's last bid 
  was a natural suggestion of a final contract.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (1), opener is showing extra 
  spade length. He may be 6-4, or he may have improvised a jump-shift with a 
  hand like<br>
  &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ10962 &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">A 
  &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K83 &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ8 
  . If you instead use Default #2, partner's 4S would be a cuebid <i><b>only</b></i> 
  if you agreed that 4C had set trumps. Most players treat 4C as a good raise, 
  and it's a game-forcing auction, but you should discuss whether or not your 
  default would apply here.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (2), partner is showing a mild 
  slam try with six hearts and a diamond fit ( &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">4 
  &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ10762 &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">K1052 
  &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">83). His round-about 
  auction shows a stronger, better-fitting hand than if he had jumped directly 
  to 4H over 2NT.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (3), you've both shown good 
  values, but the auction has turned into a scramble to find the right strain. 
  Even with all the strong bidding up to this point, partner's 4H should be 
  considered passable. Since you've shown a 3-4-5-1 pattern (identifying the 
  club weakness for notrump), partner is suggesting the 4-3 heart fit may be the 
  right spot. He may hold<br>
  &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">J652 &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AQ8 
  &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">Q1073 &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">53.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can apply the same reasoning 
  to (4), the only difference being that spades were &quot;bid&quot; with a 
  negative double. Partner's 3H cuebid was most likely a search for 3NT, but 
  he's now willing to try the 10-trick game in a 4-3 fit.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Auction (5) came from the 1995 
  European championships, where opener, a French expert, thought his partner's 
  4H was a cuebid in support of spades. Holding a 6-2-1-4 hand, he followed with 
  a 5C cuebid, which got his side dangerously high -- partner was 5-6 in the red 
  suits and meant 4H as natural and non-forcing. A default agreement would have 
  helped the pair stop in game on this misfit.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">When is your default 
  &quot;off&quot;?</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">It's important to remember that 
  these agreements apply <i><b>only</b></i> to ambiguous situations. If you've 
  previously agreed on another meaning for a sequence, or if there's already a 
  standard or &quot;obvious&quot; treatment for it, those prevail. For example, 
  Default #1 would <i><b>not</b></i> apply in these auctions:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">     <u>You     Partner</u> 
(6)   1D      1H   
      1S      3NT  
      4D      4H  

(7)   --      1S  
      1NT     3H  
      4H      4S  

</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (6), if partner really had 
  extra heart length, he had plenty of room to show it earlier. Since your 4D 
  suggested slam-try values, partner is cooperating by cuebidding the heart ace.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (7), you've already found a 
  good major-suit fit and you're in game, so there's no reason for partner to be 
  trying to talk you into a different one. He's cuebidding for a heart slam and 
  is probably hoping to hear about a minor-suit control from you.</font>

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Several experienced players who

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If your partnership has had this 
  auction before, you probably have an agreement about the meaning of the cuebid. 
  But if it's one of the hundreds (even thousands) of bidding sequences you've 
  never encountered, would you have been on the same wavelength? With which of 
  the two hands above would you or partner have bid 2D?</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Problems like this one demonstrate 
  the value of default agreements -- simple, catchall &quot;rules&quot; that can 
  be applied to situations you haven't discussed. To cover this sequence (and 
  others like it), you and partner could agree to one of these defaults:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="2">In auctions where our 
    first action is an overcall, if an opponent makes a non-penalty double:</font></strong>

  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>Default #2</u>:</strong> 
    A cuebid of the opponent's suit shows a constructive (or better) raise. It's

  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Fine-tuning your agreement</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Without further partnership 
  discussion, either one of these agreements may help you avoid a disaster in an 
  ambiguous auction. You'll defeat the purpose of the default if you make the 
  wording much more specific, but you can improve your communication by 
  discussing how you'll evaluate your hands and handle rebids.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You should specify that Default #1 
  applies only if the opponent has promised 4 cards or fewer in his suit (if the 
  opening bid is a minor or a 4-card major). If the opponent opens a 5-card 
  major, it's less likely you'd want to make a natural bid in his suit, so the 
  major-suit cuebid should be artificial and forcing.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You may also want to clarify how 
  strong your hand should be for a &quot;constructive&quot; raise. Ten or more 
  support points is a guideline you might use for responding to a direct 
  overcall, about 12 support points for a balancing overcall.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With Default #2, the cuebid by a 
  passed hand will always show trump support and at least a mild game 
  invitation. This will usually be the case if the cuebidder is an unpassed 
  hand, too. However, many pairs agree that an unpassed hand can also use a 
  cuebid to start the description of a non-supporting hand with forcing-to-game 
  strength. The cuebidder clarifies his intentions at his next turn -- his bid 
  of a new suit or notrump shows the strong hand without trump support. If you 
  play new suits are non-forcing after an overcall, you may want to adopt this 
  meaning. You can also incorporate this agreement into Default #1 by agreeing 
  that a redouble can be used to show other strong hands.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">With #2, you'll also want to 
  discuss the meaning of a redouble. It can be used as a lead director (showing 
  a top honor in partner's suit) or as a show of general high-card strength, 
  with or without support.</font>
  <h3 style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Using your default</font></h3>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Either one of these defaults would 
  clear up possible misunderstandings in auctions like these:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">      <u>RHO     You     LHO   Partner</u>    
(1)    1C     1H      DBL*    2C          * (negative) 

(2)   --      --      1C      1D 
      Pass    1S      DBL     2C   

(3)   --      --      1D     Pass  
      Pass    1S      DBL     2S   

(4)   --      --      1C      1D   
      Pass    1S      DBL    RDBL    

(5)   --      --      1C      1H   
      Pass    Pass    DBL     2C   

</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In the first two auctions, 
  partner's 2C is natural if you use Default #1; it's a cuebid for your suit if 
  you use #2. With either agreement, partner should have minimum values for his 
  2S raise in auction (3), since he would have redoubled (Default #1) or cuebid 
  (#2) if he had a good high-card raise.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (4), your agreement should help 
  you pinpoint the type of hand partner has for his redouble. With Default #1, 
  it's a supporting hand that's somewhat stronger than a minimum overcall -- 
  &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">Q107 &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ 
  &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AKJ102 &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">632 
  . If you use Default #2, partner could have cuebid 2C to make a &quot;2 
  1/2&quot; spade raise, so his redouble usually shows extra values without 
  3-card support -- &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">K3 
  &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ9 &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">AKJ102 
  &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">632.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">If you're still wondering how one 
  of your defaults could apply to (5), you already understand one of the 
  cardinal rules of using these agreements: Bridge logic and common sense always 
  override your default. Whether you've agreed to Default #1 or #2, partner's 2C 
  must be natural. Nothing has happened to make him re-evaluate his hand 
  upwards, and there's no suit he can be cuebidding for (he could have redoubled 
  or rebid his hearts if he wanted to show a long, strong suit). He might hold 
  &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">3 &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KQJ84

  .</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">You can decide for yourself which 
  default is more valuable or most in tune with your bidding style. There's no 
  guarantee that either will be optimal for a particular hand or auction, but 
  any agreement is better than none. As your partnership develops, you can 
  refine your understandings so that more are covered by specific agreements and 
  fewer are handled by the defaults.</font>

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Would you be certain about the 
  meaning of partner's bid in each of these auctions, or would they be potential 
  disasters-in-progress at your table?</font>

  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Previously, we discussed 
  agreements you could use to sort out the meaning of an ambiguous cuebid in an 
  auction where the opponent has bid only one suit. Another source of frequent 
  misunderstandings is a cuebid made after the opponents have bid two suits. In 
  the above sequences, partner had a choice of two cuebids. Do both suits convey 
  the same message, or should each have a unique meaning?</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">As with most areas of bridge 
  bidding, expert opinion varies on exactly what each cuebid should show. One 
  thing is certain, though: if you have no agreement at all, auctions like these 
  can cause panic attacks -- and disasters, when one partner thinks the 
  &quot;standard&quot; meaning is artificial, and the other thinks it's natural.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Whether you're a new or an 
  established partnership, you can avoid these guessing games by having a few 
  general &quot;default&quot; rules -- simple guidelines that can apply to many 
  possible auctions. To handle situations like those above, your partnership 
  could agree to one of three defaults:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><strong><font size="2">In auctions where the 
    opponents have bid two suits:</font></strong>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>Default #1</u>:</strong> 
    A bid of either of the opponents' suits is an artificial cuebid; <strong>OR</strong></font>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>Default #2</u>:</strong> 
    A bid of either of the opponents' suits is natural; <strong>OR</strong></font>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2"><strong><u>Default #3</u>:</strong> 
    A bid of an opponent's suit is natural if it's <strong><i>over </i></strong>the 
    opponent who originally bid the suit.<br>
    It's artificial if it's <strong><i>under</i></strong><i> </i>the original 
    bidder.<br>
    </font>
  </blockquote>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In practice, partnerships who 
  haven't discussed these cuebids tend to use Default #1. The partner of the 
  cuebidder usually follows the old rule of &quot;when in doubt, keep the 
  bidding open&quot;, even when he suspects the cuebid is natural. Without an 
  agreement, it's probably safest to assume partner meant his bid as Michaels 
  (showing the unbid suits) in auctions (1) and (2), and as an invitational 
  spade raise in (3).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Many top players endorse Default 
  #2. Their argument is that in auctions (1) and (2), partner could have doubled 
  or bid an unusual 2NT to show the unbid suits. In (3), he could raise spades 
  to the appropriate level to show a fitting hand. The only real problem comes 
  if you play weak jump raises of overcalls, since this gives partner no way to 
  make an invitational spade raise in (3).</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Though it's a bit more 
  complicated, Default #3 is probably the most flexible and widely used. Another 
  way to think of it is that when two cuebids are available, if you bid your 
  RHO's suit -- the one where the outstanding trumps will be &quot;onside&quot; 
  -- it's natural. If you bid your LHO's suit, it's artificial and forcing.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Here's how you would use Default 
  #3 in the above auctions:</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In auction (1), partner has cuebid 
  his LHO's suit, so it's an artificial takeout for the unbid suits. Since you 
  have other ways to show two suits, you may want to discuss the meanings of 
  different actions. A takeout double here tends to promise less distribution 
  (4-4 or 5-4 in your suits) and/or more defensive strength. The Michaels cuebid 
  suggests a 5-5 with weak to intermediate strength, and the unusual 2NT can be 
  reserved for the most distributional hands (6-5). If you play a weak, 
  &quot;sandwich&quot; 1NT, it can be a very light takeout.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (2), partner's 2H is natural 
  because he bid the suit that lies <i><b>over</b></i> the announced length. 
  This treatment, which can be very valuable, was developed by players who got 
  tired of being muzzled when they heard this auction and held<br>

  &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">43 &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">J102.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">In (3), partner has clubs -- 
  &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">5 &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">K65

  . If he had wanted to invite in spades, he would have chosen the artificial 
  cuebid of 2H, the suit bid on his left.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Try Default #3 with these 
  problems:</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">    <u>RHO    You   LHO   Partner</u>   
    --     --    1C     Pass  
    Pass   DBL   1S      2C   

</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Applying your default is trickier 
  here because <i><b>both</b></i> suits were bid on the cuebidder's right. If 
  partner wanted to show invitational values, his safest course would be to 
  avoid a cuebid and just bid notrump or jump in a red suit. Alternatively, you 
  could agree that in this situation, the cuebid of opener's <i><b>first</b></i> 
  suit is artificial. Since opener's bidding tends to show 5-4 in his suits, 
  it's unlikely you'd want to play in his &quot;real&quot; club suit.</font>
  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">    <u>RHO   You    LHO   Partner</u>
    --    --     1C     1H   
    1S    Pass   3S     4C    
</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Whichever default you use, bridge 
  judgment should tell you 4C is clubs, probably lots of them. As impossible as 
  this auction may seem, my partner actually trotted it out on me several years 
  ago, before we had discussed defaults for cuebids. It caused me a few anxious 
  moments -- after all, could it really be safe to pass a &quot;cuebid&quot; at 
  the <i><b>four</b></i>-level? I finally realized that a hand that started with 
  a simple 1H overcall couldn't possibly be strong enough to force now. I passed 
  with my weak 5-1-5-2 hand; partner held &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">Void 
  &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AKJ53 &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">2

  <pre style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">     <u>RHO   You   LHO   Partner
</u>     1D    DBL    1H     2H
</font></pre>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Not too many years ago, you would 
  have been laughed away from the table if you had suggested that 2H here should 
  show hearts. The standard way to show a &quot;stack&quot; was to make a 
  penalty double, which often led to awkward problems later in the bidding. 
  Today, however, there's a good case for treating partner's bid as natural 
  (just as Default #3 suggests). There's a chance your LHO psyched 1H, or he may 
  follow the modern, &quot;ignore-the-double&quot; style of responding a weak 
  4-card major. To counter, you can adopt an &quot;ignore-the-response&quot; 
  style and bid naturally.</font>
  <p style="line-height: 100%"><font size="2">Partner's 2H isn't forcing. It 
  merely shows a decent 5-card suit and the values for a freebid (about 7-9 
  playing points). He might hold &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">982 
  &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">KJ975 &nbsp; <img alt="D-" src="d.gif" width="13" height="11">654 
  &nbsp; <img alt="C-" src="c.gif" width="13" height="11">K5 . If partner 
  instead doubled, it would suggest a good 4-card heart suit with perhaps more 
  defense -- &nbsp; <img alt="S-" src="s.gif" width="13" height="11">Q5 &nbsp; <img alt="H-" src="h.gif" width="13" height="11">AJ103
